        <b>Anna:</b> Hi there! Summer in Washington, D.C. is hot and sunny. I always ride the Metro to work. Riding the
        Metro is <i>cool and fast.</i> But today it’s closed. So, I am walking to work.<br>
        (On the phone) Ms. Weaver, I am late this morning. The Metro is closed. So, I am walking to work.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> That’s too bad. It’s <i>really hot</i> today.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes it is.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> When you arrive, please come to my office. I have <i>important news</i> to tell you.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Of course. Good-bye. My boss has news for me. The question is: Is it <i>good news or bad
            news?</i><br>
        (At work)<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hello, Ms. Weaver.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Anna, I have good news and I have bad news. Which do you want to <i>hear first?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> The good news. No … okay, the bad news.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> The bad news is you are not good at reading the news.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh. I am <i>very sorry to hear that.</i><br>
        <b>Caty:</b> So, starting next month you will not read the news.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Next month <i>is July.</i> You are firing me in July.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> No. I am not firing you in July … or in August or in September. That is the good news.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Okay. You are not firing me. I am not reading the news. What will I be doing?<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Well, you are good at <i>asking questions</i>. You are good at talking to people. You are good at
        showing <i>your feelings.</i> And you are great at <i>being silly.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Thank you, Ms. Weaver. But what does all that mean?<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> I have a <i>new assignment</i> for you! Your skills are perfect for a new show … a children’s
        show.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> <i>A children’s show </i>... That is awesome! When do I start?<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> You start next month. Start thinking of ideas for the show.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I have <i>tons of ideas!</i> I can show children what it’s like in outer space ...<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Great …<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> … or in the deep, dark ocean …<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Those are great ideas, Anna. Please go think of more … at your desk.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. What other things can I show them? Mt. Everest! Everyone has <i>different skills</i>. You have
        skills. I have skills. The important thing is to know what you are good at. Until next time!
