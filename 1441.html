    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>A big snow is coming. Anna and Pete work all weekend to report on it. Have they both prepared for the blizzard?
        Let's find out!</p>
    <p>
        <b>Kelly:</b> Hi, Anna. Why do you have all this weather stuff?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I love weather.<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> Me too! Weather is so important.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> It is. It affects people’s lives!<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> Have you ever reported on a big weather event?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I have. I’ve reported on a blizzard.<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> Do mean the one last weekend?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Yes! I had been waiting for that blizzard for years. When it came, I was ready.<br>

        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> Welcome to our most perfect lesson! Why is it perfect? Today we are reviewing the present
        perfect and past perfect verb tenses. These show that an action is completed.<br>

        <b>Kelly uses the present perfect when she says,</b><br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> Have you ever reported on a big weather event?<br>

        <b>Anna uses the past perfect when she says,</b><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I had been waiting for that blizzard for years.<br>

        <b>Listen for "have" or "had" and the past participle to find more sentences with the perfect tense. I'll color
            those words to help you.</b><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I have wanted to report on a big weather event my whole life.<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> Who hasn’t? Did you report all weekend ... by yourself?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> No, no. I volunteered Pete to help me.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Why am I here on a Saturday? Why are you carrying things? Why? Why?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Pete, these are my supplies – food, a blanket; warm clothing. Where are your supplies?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Pete, Pete, Pete. This could be the “blizzard of the century.”<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> It’ll be fine.<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> How else had you prepared?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Well, I had just bought the latest weather forecasting software. So, I brought it!<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> Do you mean The Weather Genie Pro?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> You know it. Pete thought it was pretty great too.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Do you have any games on that thing?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Yes! I have the best weather survival game. Boom!<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Sounds fun.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> It is. But right now, Pete, this computer is a work tool. It will give us the temperature, wind
        speed, wind direction and amount of snowfall … in real time! Boom, boom!<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> I can’t wait.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Pete, we need a name for this blizzard.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> No, we don’t.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> All the great storms have names.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> No, they don’t.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I know -- “The Big Snow!”<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> I am not saying “The Big Snow.”<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Welcome to “The Big Snow.”<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> The Big Snow broke all kinds of records, didn’t it?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Yes it did. And every time a record was broken, we celebrated!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> So far, in Washington, D.C. 29 inches of snow has fallen. That, my dear listeners, is a record!
        (Honks horn)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> We just broke the wind speed record! (Honks horn)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Snow has been falling for 30 hours straight! That’s another record! (Honks horn. Pete comes into
        room and breaks the horn.)<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> By Saturday night, stores and restaurants had closed. Did you bring enough food?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I thought I had brought enough food. But I ran out.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Hey, Pete, where is my bag of popcorn?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Maybe you ate it already.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> No, I didn’t.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> I haven't seen it. (Pete has popcorn in his beard. Anna tries to hit him.)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> We had reported together for 48 hours straight!<br>

        <b>Kelly:</b> Wow. That must have been a great team-building exercise for you and Pete.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Yeah. You - you could say that.<br>

        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> I hope you found all the sentences with perfect tenses. Learn more on our website!
