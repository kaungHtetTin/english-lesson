        <b>Anna:</b> This is the Roosevelt Memorial. Where is the symbol?<br>
        Anna remembers that Dan said: You have to find things that aren't really there. ... When you find an American
        symbol, you win points and a Fun Fact about a U.S. President.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yay! I found Uncle Sam and I won another 40 points! What is the Fun Fact?<br>
        <b>Voice:</b> Franklin Roosevelt was <i>the first to fly in a plane as president!</i><br>

        <b>Voice:</b> Abraham Lincoln was <i>a great wrestler!</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I didn't know that. Lincoln wanted <i>freedom for all people.</i> So, the Statue of Liberty works
        well.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> And I won 20 points! Time to find the next symbol.<br>
        <b>Dan:</b> Hey! Look out!<br>

        <b>Dan:</b> Dan. What’s yours?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Anna.<br>
        <b>Dan:</b> <i>Like Americana</i>!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yeah, I guess so.<br>
        <b>Dan:</b> Did you find any symbols?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes, I found three and <i>won 120 points!</i><br>
        <b>Dan:</b> Me too. But, did you find the <i>bald eagle?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No. Did you?<br>
        <b>Dan:</b> No.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> First one to find it wins?<br>
