        <b>Anna:</b> Hello! Today is a big day. My first children’s show is on television! Woo-hoo! <i>I’m excited and
            nervous.</i><br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Hello, Anna.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hello, Ms. Weaver!<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Some people are going to watch your children’s show. After they watch it, they’ll tell me
        what they liked, and what they didn’t like.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh, dear.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> They’re in <i>the conference room.</i> They’re in the conference room.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hello, everyone. I’m Anna, and thanks for coming!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Today you are going to watch my new show. I hope you like it<br>
        <b>Coworker 2:</b> What is the show about?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> It’s a children’s show.<br>
        <b>Coworker 1:</b> But we are not children!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> This children's show is different. I hope.<br>
        <b>Coworker 3:</b> I don’t really like children's shows.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Shhh, please. The show <i>is starting!</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh, hi! Just give me one minute ….oops! Oh well. I can fix that later.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hello, I’m Anna! Welcome to <i>“The Time Traveling Treehouse!”</i> This is not a usual treehouse.
        It can time travel! That is why it’s called "The Time Traveling Treehouse."<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> Anna, do not forget me.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Of course not! This is my partner, MINDY!<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> My name means Massive Information Navigation Device, for You!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> That means we can travel to many places and learn many things. Kids from all over the world ask us
        questions. We find them answers!<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> Woo-hoo! That is right, Anna.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> MINDY, what is our first question?<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> Layla asks us this question.<br>
        <b>Layla:</b> Hello, Anna! Hello, MINDY! I'd like to know -- how do you play baseball?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> That is <i>a great question!</i> MINDY, we need to find her an answer!<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> I know that we can find it, Anna!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Where am I now? MINDY, now I am on <i>a snowy mountain!</i><br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> That is a good place to learn how to ski.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes, MINDY, but it cannot teach us about baseball! And I don’t know how to ski!<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> Sorry, Anna. Let’s try again.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Where I am now!? MINDY, I am in the ocean! An ocean cannot teach us about baseball!<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> Please don’t yell, Anna. The ocean can teach <i>us about surfing.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes, MINDY, it can teach us about surfing … and sharks! Ahhh!<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> Anna, please wait. I need to fix <i>my navigation device</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> MINDY, please fix it faster. And get me out of here … now!<br>
        <b>Announcer:</b> Whoa! Is Anna going to be lost forever? Next week, you can watch part two of “The Time
        Traveling Treehouse!”<br>
        <b>Coworker 1:</b> Aw, man! Will the shark eat her?<br>
        <b>Coworker 2:</b> Will Anna find the answer?<br>
        <b><b>Coworker 3:</b></b> Please tell me the ending!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> So, you liked it?<br>
        <b>Coworkers:</b> Yes!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Well, you can watch the ending next week!<br>
        <b>Coworkers:</b> Noooooo!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Don’t forget to watch next week!
