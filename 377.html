        <b>Caty:</b> Now, Anna, remember. When we read the news we are <i>always reading facts.</i> We never show our feelings.<br>

        <b>Caty:</b> Stop! Anna, when you say the words “duck” and “duckling” you look really sad.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I do?<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Yes. Sad is a feeling.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Sad is not a fact. Sorry. Let me try again.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Okay, she’s trying again! And go.<br>
