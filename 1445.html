    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Anna hires a trainer to get back into shape. Her trainer does not read her application carefully. So, he offers
        her a workout program that she does not enjoy.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope, even though we both love speed walking, could we slow down a bit?<br>

        <b> Penelope:</b> No way! I think because I’m walking with you, I’m walking faster.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Come on, Penelope. Let's take a break. We've been speed walking since 8 a.m.! You're so
        competitive! You even wore your medals!<br>

        <b> Penelope:</b> You brought your trophies! You’re out of shape. When we were little girls, we could speed walk
        all day! (pulls ahead)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> (chases her) Hey, wait for me! Hey, you know the speed walking rules! If both feet leave the
        ground, it’s running! You ran!<br>

        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> Anna and Penelope are doing something they both love - speed walking!<br>

        They are also using adverb clauses.<br>

        Adverb clauses tell us when, why, how, where and under what conditions.<br>

        For example, "since 8 a.m." tells us when.<br>

        Adverb clauses are dependent clauses and need an independent clause to make a complete sentence.<br>

        Words like before, after, when, because, since, if and even though can signal an adverb clause.<br>

        Keep watching for more adverb clauses!<br>

        <b> Penelope:</b> Whew! That was great!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> (Anna catches up) Wow, Penelope, you’re still really fast! Since I’ve been working in an office, my
        speed walking has been much slower.<br>

        <b> Penelope:</b> You are slower, Anna. Maybe you should hire a personal trainer.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That will be great. As long as the trainer understands speed walking.<br>

        <b> Penelope:</b> (hands her a business card) Try this company. After you fill out an online application, they
        will match you to the perfect trainer.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> As soon as I get home tonight, I’ll do it! Thanks.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Are you my trainer?<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> If you’re Anna, then I’m your trainer -- Alaskan Albert. Because I’m from Alaskan
        wilderness, I’m skilled in all outdoor activities of the wild.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That’s great but what about speed walking?<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> Speed walking? That's funny! Since I’ve been living in the city, I’ve combined wilderness
        training with a city workout. I call it “Call of the Wild Parkour!” (He howls like a wolf.)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Okay … but seriously, when do we speed walk?<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> Your application did not say how funny you are!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> No. But it did say that I'm a speed walker! Did you read it? Forget it. We'll have to cancel.<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> Why?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> We can't train today because it's too cold and too windy.<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> No way! No pain, no gain! When you exercise in really cold weather, you feel alive!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Really? Because right now I just feel cold.<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> You're so funny. But seriously, after our training, you will be ready for any extreme
        physical challenge. Let's get started!<br>

        (He leads Anna through some parkour exercises.)<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> Anna, even though you’re trying really hard, you’re really bad at Call of the Wild
        Parkour. (he howls)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I'm bad at Call of the Wild Parkour because I don’t want to do Call of the Wild Parkour! (she
        howls) I am a speed walker. It’s what I do. It’s part of who I am.<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> Why didn’t you say something?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I did. Several times! You thought I was joking.<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> Now I understand. Anna, I can help you., if you follow my advice, I'll put the speed back
        in your speed walk.<br>

        (He shows her how to improve her speed walking)<br>

        <b>Alaskan Albert:</b> Go, Anna, go!<br>
