    <p>
      <b>  Penelope:</b> Anna, thanks for taking me on a tour of D.C. today.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Sure thing, Penelope. You are new to town. And a tour is the best way to see more of the city!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> So, which tour are we taking – the one that goes through the city on a bus? Or the one that goes along the river in a boat?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Both!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> What? Anna, this isn’t going to be one of those trips, is it?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> No. Follow me.<br>
        
        <b>Professor Bot:</b> In this lesson, you are going to hear lots of prepositions! What’s a preposition, you ask? It’s a word that shows relationships between things. Anna says they are going on a tour through the city and along the river. Through and along are both prepositions. Watch for more!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Well, Penelope, there’s our ride!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> What is it?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> It’s the famous DC Ducks -- the boat with wheels! We will ride on the road and then sail on the water!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> Who thinks of these things?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> I don't know. But I’m glad they do! Let’s get aboard, Sailor!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> (looking at a brochure about the boat) Hey, did you know that this bus … um, boat was created during World War II to carry people and supplies?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Wow. You know, a tour is so much more interesting with Fun Facts, like that one.<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> I agree. I love Fun Facts!<br>
        
        <b>Boy:</b> Did I hear you say you love Fun Facts?<br>
        
        <b>Anna & Penelope:</b> Yeah.<br>
        
        <b>Boy:</b> Well, I have tons of Fun Facts for this tour!<br>
        
        <b>Anna & Penelope:</b> Great!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope, where are his parents?<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> Maybe - maybe he’s the Captain’s son and he helps his dad on tours!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh yeah! It would be so awesome to ride around the city in a boat all day with your dad!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> This is amazing, Anna. There are so many beautiful buildings along this road!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Hey, the Washington Monument is on the left!<br>
        
        <b>Professor Bot:</b> I have a Fun Fact too! Did you know that the Washington Monument was damaged in an earthquake? Whoa. Did you feel that?!<br>
        
        I heard: "around the city in a boat," "along this road and "on the left." All of these are prepositions showing place. Let's watch for more places and prepositions!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> Look, Anna, we’re across from the White House!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope, the only thing between us and the President is the street … and a park … and a security gate .... and police officers … with guns.<br>
        
        <b>Boy:</b> Excuse me, do you want to know a Fun Fact about the White House?<br>
        
        <b>Anna & Penelope:</b> Yes!<br>
        
        <b>Boy:</b> Inside the White House there is a swimming pool, a movie theater and 32 bathrooms!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> Thirty-two bathrooms! That’s a lot of bathrooms!<br>
        
        <b>Boy:</b> I’d be happy with two. I live in a house with my mom, four sisters, two aunts and only one bathroom!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> Oh my! You know, Anna, we should give him a tip!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Of course! It is polite to tip your tour guide! Luckily, I have lots of dollar bills!<br>
        
      <b>  Penelope:</b> That was a great Fun Fact! Here you go!<br>
        
        <b>Boy:</b> Thank you! I can tell you Fun Facts all day!<br>
        
        <b>Professor Bot:</b> Did you hear any more prepositions of place? I heard "between us and the president" “inside the White House" and "in a house."<br>
        
        And did you hear that the Duck Boat can go on the river? I don't believe it. Join us next time to find out which preposition we will use: The boat went ON the river or The boat went INTO the river?
