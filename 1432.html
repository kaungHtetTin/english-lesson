        <b>Anna:</b> Ms. Weaver is giving new assignments out. I am ready to take on anything she gives me. Well, except
        reporting traffic from a helicopter. Wish me luck.<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> I wonder what Anna’s new assignment will be? Professor Bot here! While you are watching,
        look for phrasal, or two-word verbs. Some stay together, like “go back” and some can come apart, like “give
        [assignments] out.” Good luck, Anna!<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> So, as I said at the meeting last week, I have new assignments for everyone at The Studio.
        Anna, you're good at asking questions. So, I want you to go back to hosting and reporting.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That sounds great.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> You're also a team player. So, I want you team up with someone ...
        <br>
        <b>Anna:</b> That sounds even better!<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> ... someone who is very "different" from you.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That sounds ... what do you mean "different"?<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Well, you are very cheerful, you're a people person. I want you to team up with someone who
        ... isn't.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Ms. Weaver, I will find that person.<br>

        <b>Mimi:</b> Excuse me. Are you using this chair?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Yes.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Pete, hi! Thanks for meeting me.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Sure. But I don’t have lots of time, Anna. I’m busy looking for work.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Pete, you can tear these want ads up and throw them away! I have good news!<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Anna, I was working on that crossword puzzle.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Pete, forget about the crossword puzzle. I have a job offer for you!<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> I'm listening.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> My boss wants me to team up with someone to host a talk show. But the person must be different from
        me. So, I thought of you.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Different from you? What do you mean?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I'm sorry, Pete, I don't have time right now. Here's my boss's address. Your interview is tomorrow
        morning at 10 am.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> But what do you mean “different”?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Just be yourself, Pete. Just be yourself.<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> Did you find any two-word verbs? Here’s one example. Pete can throw the want ads away!
        Throw away is a two-word verb.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Thanks for coming in, Pete.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Thanks for the opportunity, Ms. Weaver.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> I need to find out if you have the skills for this job. And I want you to be completely
        honest.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Okay.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> First, let's talk about your personal skills. Pete, are you a people person?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Well, okay, sometimes I think people talk too much.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Pete, what work of yours are you most proud of?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Last year, I locked myself in a cabin and wrote a book. I didn't speak to anybody the entire time!
        It was the best two months of my life.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Okay. I think I’ve heard enough.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Hey! Hey, Pete, how was the interview with Ms. Weaver?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Well, she said I was grumpy and not good with people.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> And … ?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> And, I got the job!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I knew it! Congratulations! Let's go celebrate.<br>
