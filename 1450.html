    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Anna, Penelope and Rick are making a news story about the Washington Car Show. Anna is having a lot of fun --
        maybe too much fun...</p>

    <p>
        <b>Anna:</b> (to Penelope) That’s a great idea. (to Rick) Rick, I think we should use this as the opening
        shot.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Anna, did Ms. Weaver give us instructions for covering the car show?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> She did. She said that we need to show lots of cars. She said we need to interview people. And she
        also said that we should have fun.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Those were her exact words?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Yeah. She said, “Have fun, Anna!” And she is the boss.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> (to Rick) Okay, Rick, are you - are you ready? OK. Hello, I'm Anna Matteo. Welcome to the
        Washington Car Show!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> People all over town are saying that if you like cars, this is the place to be! So, let's see what
        people are talking about. (at Rick) How was that? Okay? Is that Good?<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> Anna, Penelope and Rick are making a news story about the Washington Car Show. Ms. Weaver
        gave them instructions.<br>

        We often need to tell others what someone else said.<br>

        There are two ways to do this. One is to use the person’s exact words and use quotation marks. We call this
        "direct speech."<br>

        For example, Ms. Weaver had said, “You need to show lots of cars.”<br>

        The other way is to talk about what someone said. We call this "reported speech."<br>

        Anna tells <b>Penelope:</b> She said that we need to show lots of cars.<br>

        In this sentence, "she," is the subject, “said” is the reporting verb, “that” is the conjunction and “we need to
        show lots of cars” is the reporting clause.<br>

        Keep watching, and listen for sentences where Anna talks about what someone else said!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> This car show has many styles of vehicles. There are utility vehicles, classic cars, trucks, sports
        cars, and everyday vehicles.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Okay, I think we got good interviews.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Me too! People had very different opinions. But they all said they loved cars.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Anna, look -- a robot!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> A robot!<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> A robot!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Rick, we have to use the robot in the show!<br>

        (They walk over to the robot. Anna begins to dance like a robot.)<br>

        Robot: What is your first name?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Anna! Anna!<br>

        Robot: Anna, you know, what an effort. What an effort to robot dance. How about a round of applause for Anna!
        I’ve never seen anyone try so hard.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope, did you hear that? Hank the Robot said that he has never seen anyone dance like me.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Uh, I think many people here are saying that, Anna.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That was fun. You know what someone told me? You can test drive a Jaguar at this car show.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Now, that sounds fun.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Let’s go.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Okay.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> This course is smooth. So you can drive faster.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> He said...that I can’t drive, unfortunately.<br>

        (They begin the test drive. Kurt, the stunt driver, does the driving.)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Oh my gosh…reverse.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That was great. This is awesome.<br>

        <b>Kurt:</b> Are you ready to go on the rollercoaster?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I’m ready.<br>

        <b>Kurt:</b> Here we go!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That’s awesome.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That was...That was awesome! I just want to go one more time. I promise. That’s it. Just one more
        time.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> This course is bumpy and uneven. I was told that I could drive this course. So I am.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> (to Rick) Okay, Rick, are you rolling? Awesome. Okay, this course is uneven. But I think the ride
        will be smooth.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Ooh. This hill is really steep.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Oh my gosh. I can’t tell you how much fun this is.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope, that was so much fun! I think I need to go again.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Uh, Anna, I think we have enough test drive video.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Ms. Weaver said to get a lot. So, I think I should go again. (to Rick) Rick, I’m going to go again.
        <br>Until next time!<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> But I want to get lunch, Anna!<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> Penelope said she wants to go to lunch. But I don’t think that’s going to happen soon.
