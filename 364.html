        <b>Anna:</b> Hi. I am walking to work. Today my boss will tell me what she thinks of my work. Is it good? Or is it bad? Okay, <i>time for work.</i> I am going right now. Okay, okay, I’m going!<br><br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Anna, hello.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hello.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Sit down. As you know, at the start of a new year we <i>have a work review.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. It’s time for mine.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Yes. Anna, this chart shows <i>the audience of The Time Traveling Treehouse.</i> If you look at it, you will see something bad. Your audience is going down, down, DOWN!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Ms. Weaver, I think the chart is upside down.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Here, <i>let’s flip that around</i>. Now, it’s right-side up.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Oh. If you look at this chart, you will see something good. Your audience is big.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Good!<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> But not big enough.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Not good.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> I want to see these numbers go up, and up, and UP!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> How?<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> I have something -- <i>idea posters!</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> (whispers) Idea posters.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> You really <i>ought to think</i> seriously about them. I like this one. Please read it.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> <i>“If at first you SUCCEED; you will be a success.”</i> Well, it's a cute cat.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Here’s another one. I like it.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> <i>“WORKING HARD looks hard because it really is hard.”</i> I see. It's another cute cat.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> This is my favorite.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> <i>“TEAMWORK works best with a team.”</i> A team of cats. Look at all those cats!<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> So, Anna, do you understand what I want?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes, Ms. Weaver. I understand.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Okay, team. There is a problem in the Treehouse.<br>
        <b>Amelia:</b> Problem? What's the problem?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Our audience is big.<br>
        <b>Bryan:</b> But that's a good thing.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No, it is not big enough.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Please don’t worry. I know what Ms. Weaver wants. Here’s the plan. (whispers)<br>
        <b>Bryan:</b> Is that what she wants?<br>
        <b>Amelia:</b> Are you sure?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. Let’s <i>get to work!</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Good job, team. This is exactly what Ms. Weaver wants!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Welcome to The Time Traveling Treehouse! Today you will learn about a very popular pet … cats!<br>
        <b>MINDY:</b> Anna. Did I give you enough cats?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I don’t know, MINDY. I think we need more cats!
