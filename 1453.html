    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Anna interviews musician Emma G on her show. But, her excitement starts to become a little....strange.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hello?<br><br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Anna, this is Ms. Weaver.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Ms. Weaver!<br><br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Tomorrow, you’ll be interviewing musician Emma G.<br><br>

        (Anna is very excited. She loves Emma G’s music.)<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Emma G?! I will be talking to Emma G?!<br><br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Anna? Anna, are you there?<br><br>

        Professor Bot: Anna and Ms. Weaver used the future continuous verb tense to talk about the interview.<br><br>

        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> We use future continuous to talk about actions that will be in progress at or around a time in
        the future.<br><br>

        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> For example, Ms. Weaver says, “Tomorrow, you’ll be interviewing musician Emma G.”<br><br>

        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> There are two options for future continuous. The first is: will be + the -ing form of the
        verb<br><br>

        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> And the second is: be + going to be + the -ing form of the verb. Keep watching for
        more!<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Hello and welcome to The Music! Today, musician Emma G will be joining us here!<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> She is a wonderful songwriter and an amazing singer. And I love her! Let’s give a warm welcome to
        Emma G!<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Hi. Thank you for coming on the show, Emma G.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Of course. It’s great to be here.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Well, we can’t wait to hear you sing. I listen to your music a lot. So, I feel like I know you. Is
        that strange?<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Anna, listening to music can be a very personal experience. So, no, that’s not strange.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Good because I made something for you -- a video scrapbook of our friendship.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I took photos of you and added myself. I worked on it all weekend.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Well, that -- that’s strange. Is that even -- is that even legal?<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Now, Emma, let’s talk about your schedule. Tell me ... I mean, tell us exactly where you will be
        and when. Exactly.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Sure. Well, in early June, I’ll be performing at several venues across Austin, Texas.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That’s my vacation week. I can meet you there! We can tour the city. We can have lunch.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Um, yeah maybe. Then in mid-July, I’m going to be teaching at a music camp in Chicago.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I’ll be visiting my sister then. She only lives about six hours from Chicago! I could drive over.
        We could hang out.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Yeah, uh maybe. You know, maybe now is a good time for some music.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That’s a great idea. Now, let's hear a song from Emma G.!<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> I wrote this song a couple of years ago. It’s called “Wary.”<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Do you believe in happy endings?<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Endings...<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Do you really believe that we could be…<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Be...<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> I think something is wrong. I hear a voice in the background.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Sorry. Sorry, Emma. That was me. I’m just so excited.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> No problem. I'm glad you like the song.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> You go ahead. You go ahead.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Okay. Do you believe in happy endings?<br><br>

        (She hears a tambourine playing and looks at Anna.)<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Anna, there’s no tambourine in this.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, Emma. See, I’ve always wanted to sing with you.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Well, come on over then and we can sing a song together first.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> No, I couldn't.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Come on. It’ll be fun.<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Okay! Here. I brought my favorite song.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Oh, uh okay. Actually, I like this song. Um, are you ready?<br><br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Yes! Yes!<br><br>

        <b>Emma G:</b> Okay.<br><br>

        <b>Emma G / Anna together:</b><br><br>

        Every breath you take*<br>
        Every move you make<br>
        Every bond you break<br>
        Every step you take<br>
        I'll be watching you …<br>
        I’ll be watching you...<br>
        I’ll be watching you...

    <p style="color: rgb(40, 156, 252);font-weight: 1000;">Practice</p>
    <p>Now, you try it!<br><br>

        First, read about the future continuous verb tense below. Then, write two or three sentences in the Comments
        section about your future plans.<br><br>

        Be sure to use future continuous in each sentence!<br><br>

        <b>Future Continuous</b><br>
        We use the future continuous verb tense for future actions that will continue for a period of time.<br><br>

        Future continuous is used only for action verbs. An action verb is a verb that expresses a physical or mental
        action. Examples are: write, read, sing, work, think and stop. Verbs like be, become, feel and look are not
        action verbs.<br><br>

        <b>Future continuous:</b><br>

        -for action verbs only<br>
        -has two forms<br><br>
        <b>Forms:</b><br>

        -will be + ing verb<br>
        -be + going to be + ing verb<br><br>
        <b>Examples:</b><br>

        -Today, musician Emma G will be joining us here!<br>
        -In early June, I’ll be performing at several venues across Austin, Texas.<br>
        -Are you going to be teaching at the music camp in Chicago this July?<br>
        -She won't be returning to Washington, DC until the end of the summer.<br>
        -I will be becoming happy when you visit my show tomorrow. (wrong)<br>
        With the future continuous, we often shorten the part of verb that comes after the subject. Look at the examples
        (You'll, I'll, I'm).<br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>subject</td>
            <td>will be</td>
            <td>-ing verb</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>You</td>
            <td>'ll be</td>
            <td>
                interviewing</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Emma G.</td>
            <td>
                will be</td>
            <td>joining</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>I</td>
            <td>'ll be</td>
            <td>performing</td>
        </tr>
    </table><br>
    In the second form of the future continuous verb tense, the verb to be is conjugated -- it changes to match the
    subject. See the examples below.<br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>subject</td>
            <td>to be (conjugated)</td>
            <td>going to be</td>
            <td>-ing verb</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>I</td>
            <td>'m</td>
            <td>going to be</td>
            <td>teaching</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>They</td>
            <td>are</td>
            <td>going to be</td>
            <td>singing</td>
        </tr>
    </table><br>
    <b>Test Yourself</b><br>
    How well do you know the grammar from Level 2? Test yourself!<br><br>

    In Lesson 23, you will see examples of grammar that you have learned in Level 2. Look for sentences in Lesson 23
    with:<br><br>

    -Passive voice<br>
    -Prepositions<br>
    -Reflexive pronouns<br>
    -Present perfect<br>
    -Verbs talk, speak, tell and/or say<br>
    Then, write those sentences in the Comments section. For example, "I’ll be performing at several venues across
    Austin, Texas" uses the preposition at.
