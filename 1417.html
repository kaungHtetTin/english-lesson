        <b>Anna:</b> Happy New Year! Some people, at the start of a new year, make a resolution -- a promise to yourself
        to be better. I thought about <i>my resolution carefully.</i> I want to be an actor on the stage! Today I will
        audition for a show called "The Woods Are Alive!" Wish me luck!<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Next! What is your name?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> My name is Anna Matteo.<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Are you <i>ready to audition?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> (warms up voice) Yes.<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Great. Let's begin on page 1. Here is the story. You are <i>lost in the woods.</i> You are
        searching desperately for a way out. Suddenly, you hear something.<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Now, say your line.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> 'What was that? Hello. Is someone there?'<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Anna, you are speaking too softly. Can you speak more loudly and a little more, um,
        seriously?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes, of course I can. 'What was that? Hello. Is someone there?' <i>Is that loud enough?</i><br>
        <b>Director:</b> Yes, that is loud enough. Let's turn to page 25. <i>In this scene,</i> you are moving slowly
        and quietly through the woods.<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Anna. Anna! You are walking quickly and loudly. Walk slowly and quietly.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I'm walking slowly and quietly. I am walking…<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Anna. Anna. You don't need to say "slowly" and "quietly." Alright, let's try the last scene.
        Turn to page 48. I say my line first, then you say your line.<br>
        <b>Director:</b> 'You will never get out of <i>these woods alive!</i> Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!'<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> 'Yes, I will.'<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Okay, Anna, you said that line -- you said that line really late. You need to say it
        earlier.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Sorry. Sorry. Let me try again.<br>
        <b>Director:</b> 'You will never …'<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> 'Yes, I will.'<br>
        <b>Director:</b> '… get out of the woods alive.'<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I was too early, wasn't I?<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Yes. Yes, you were.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Director, how am I doing?<br>
        <b>Director:</b> You know, Anna. I think that I have <i>the perfect part for you.</i><br>
        <b>Director:</b> The costume is in the back. Please go try it on.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Awesome! (Anna returns as a tree.)<br>
        <b>Director:</b> Oh, Anna, that <i>fits you perfectly!</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I'm a tree. I'm a tree in … "The Woods Are Alive!" Yes!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> My new year is starting awesomely! Excuse me, Director! I have a great idea for my tree. Oh, wait!
        Until next time!
