        <b>KELLY:</b> Oh, Anna, there you are! I am so glad we joined the Great City Bird Count! Aren't you?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> No. Today has been a bust … a flop … a bummer!<br><br>
        
        <b>KELLY:</b> I’m sensing a little disappointment.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> A little?<br><br>
        
        <b>KELLY:</b> My official bird-watching form is almost full!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I've only seen pigeons ... lots and lots of pigeons! But I did write down some other valuable information.<br><br>
        
        <b>KELLY:</b> Did you find a bird's nest?!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> No.<br><br>
        
        (She shows Kelly a map of ice cream trucks.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I found 10 ice cream trucks in this five-block area.​ Their music seems to follow me everywhere.<br><br>
        
        <b>KELLY:</b> We're supposed to be counting birds, not ice cream trucks. This is important scientific work!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Well, when you want ice cream, my data will be pretty important.<br><br>
        
        <b>KELLY:</b> Anna, birds are everywhere! I’m sure you’ll find something. Use your imagination! But, make sure that you put it on the official form.<br><br>
        
        (Anna walks away with her ice cream truck map.)<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Anna was supposed to find birds, but she didn’t.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Kelly says, “We're supposed to be counting birds, not ice cream trucks.” To be supposed to means you are expected to do something.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> It’s different from have to and ought to. Have to means you must do something. And ought to means you should do it but you don’t have to.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Keep watching for have to and ought to!<br><br>
        
        (Anna looks through binoculars but doesn't see birds. She talks to herself.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> No birds. Oh wait, there’s another ice cream truck! Anna, focus on birds. Aw, but that truck has my favorite flavor ... banana!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> That man is in the way. I can’t see the price. I wonder what flavor he's getting.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Strawberry? He doesn't seem like a strawberry kind of guy.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> In fact, he doesn't seem like an ice cream truck kind of guy. That suit looks expensive.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Maybe he's a spy! You know what that means: The ice cream truck driver is a spy, too!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Genius! It’s a perfect disguise.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> What?! The man in the suit left his briefcase at the ice cream truck!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I was right! He is a spy! And, he just dropped off top-secret information! I ought to do something. Something needs to be done! I need to do something.<br><br>
        
        (Anna runs to the ice cream truck and takes the briefcase.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I did it! I took the spy’s briefcase!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> What’s that?! The ice cream truck -- it’s following me! It wants the case back! I have to hide.<br><br>
        
        (She runs and hides behind a tree.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> This is my life now -- running, scared, alone.<br><br>
        
        (She runs to another tree.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> That awful music -- it’s following me everywhere!<br><br>
        
        (The man sees her at the tree.)<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> Hey! You found my briefcase.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> You caught me! I mean, I caught you!<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> Well, I just want my briefcase. All my poems are in there.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Poems? You’re a poet?<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> Well, I'm a lawyer. But I write poems, too.<br><br>
        
        (Anna gives the man his briefcase.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> So, you’re not a spy?<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> You look disappointed.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> No, that’s okay. It’s not your fault. Poems are nice, too. I guess.<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> Well, would you like me to read my latest one?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Why not?<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> On sunny day walks, my hand reaches for ice cream from fragaria.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I love your poem!<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> I love ice cream.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Me too.<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> What's your favorite flavor?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Banana.<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> Well, my favorite flavor is ...<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Strawberry!<br><br>
        
        <b>MAN:</b> How did you know that?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> A little bird told me.

            <b>Grammar</b><br>
In past Let's Learn English lessons, you learned about the modal verbs have to and ought to. Today, you learned be supposed to. English learners sometimes confuse them:<br><br>

<i><b>Be supposed to</b></i> means to be expected to do something. But, sometimes we use it to say what someone is allowed to do.<br>

Examples:<br>

-“We're supposed to be counting birds, not ice cream trucks.” -Kelly<br>
-I am supposed to meet someone for lunch at noon.<br>
-They were not supposed to stay in the store after it closed.<br><br>
<i><b>Have to</b></i> has the same meaning as must. In American English, have to is much more common than must.<br>

Examples:<br>

-“I have to hide!” -Anna<br>
-We have to leave by 9am to catch the tour.<br>
-What time do you have to be at work?<br><br>
<i><b>Ought to</b></i> has the same meaning as should. But, it is less common and more formal. Sometimes, it is used for saying what is probable.<br>

Examples:<br>

-“I ought to hide!” -Anna<br>
-You ought to visit us for the holiday.<br>
-The show ought to be done in an hour.<br>

    <tr><td>ought to</td>
    <td>ought to + simple verb</td></tr>
</table><br>
<b>Expressing Disappointment</b><br>
In friendly situations, we sometimes use informal language to show disappointment.<br><br>

For example, Anna says, "Today has been a bust...a flop...a bummer!"<br><br>

Bust, flop, and bummer are three informal words that show disappointment. Bust and flop mean a complete failure. A bummer is something unpleasant or disappointing.<br><br>

Examples:<br>
-I lost my phone. What a bummer!<br>
-Last night's event was a real bust.<br>
-The film was so boring. It was a flop.<br>

Sometimes, we can tell a person nicely that they did not cause the disappointment.<br><br>


For example, Anna learns that the man with the briefcase is not a spy. She is disappointed, but says: "No, that’s okay. It’s not your fault."<br><br>
<b>Writing Practice</b><br><br>
Now, you try it!<br>

1. Write about something that should or must happen soon in your life or in your city or town. Use be supposed to, have to and ought to.<br><br>

2. What is something that you or someone else has felt disappointed about? Write a few sentences about it. Use language from today's lesson to show disappointment.<br>
