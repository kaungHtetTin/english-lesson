        <b>Anna:</b> Hello! I am sure that today, in Washington, D.C,. there are a lot of great things to do. But I am not doing any of them. I am sick. Right now, I'm going to call my boss and tell her I cannot come in to work.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Hello?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Ms. Weaver, Hi. I can’t come to work today.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Why not? <i>What is wrong?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Well, yesterday I felt fine.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> In the morning, I <i>painted for hours.</i> In the afternoon, I cut wood. Then, I built a fire.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> Anna, what do you mean? Why can’t you come to work today?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I do not feel well. I think I’m sick.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> I’m sorry to hear that. I was sick last week, too. I had the flu.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> (sneezes) What did you do?<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> I slept a lot and I drank a lot of water. Do you have a doctor?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes, I do.<br>
        <b>Caty:</b> You should call your doctor. And get <i>lots of rest!</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Thanks, Ms. Weaver. I’ll call right now. I'm calling my doctor.<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> (to herself) Now, where does this thing go?<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> Hello. This is Dr. Bennett. How can I help you?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hello, Dr. Bennett. This is Anna.<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> Oh, Hi, Anna. How can I help you?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I think <i>I’m sick.</i><br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> Let me ask you a couple of questions. Do you have a <i>sore throat</i> ?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. I have a sore throat.<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> Do you have <i>a cough?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. I have a cough.<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> When did you start feeling sick?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> This morning. Yesterday I felt great. In the morning I painted, for hours - in the afternoon I cut wood -<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> Excuse me, Anna. But I don’t need to know all that. Do you have <i>a fever?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh. My thermometer says <i>125 degrees?!</i> What??<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> Yeah, that’s not right.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh. Wait. The thermometer was in my hot cup of coffee.<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> Please take it again, Anna.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Okay, the thermometer says 100.5 degrees.<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> 100.5 degrees is not too high. I want you to drink lots of water. Rest in bed and get lots of sleep.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> That is what my boss said to do. Um, Dr. Bennett, when can I go to work?<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> Don’t go to work for a couple of days.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes! I mean, I don’t want to make my co-workers sick.<br>
        <b>Dr. Bennett:</b> That’s right. Call me back in <i>a couple of days.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I will, Dr. Bennett. And thanks.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Well, you heard the doctor – no work for a couple of days. I need water, sleep and um … lots of movies! Well, the doctor didn’t say anything about movies. But it can’t hurt! Until next time!
