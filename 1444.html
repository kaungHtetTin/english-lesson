    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Pete and Ashley have found perfect partners. Anna says she has a new boyfriend but Pete and Ashley don't believe
        her. Is he real or not?</p>

    <p>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hello! What are you guys looking at?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> I’m showing Ashley pictures of my girlfriend. We have so much in common -- even small things. She
        can’t whistle and I can’t either.<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> (to Pete) And here’s a picture of my boyfriend. (sighs)<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> My family is big and so is his. I don’t like ball sports and he doesn’t either! (sighs) We are
        made for each other ...<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> … and so are we. (sighs)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Uh… you have found perfect partners … and so have I!<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> Pete and Ashley are talking about people they love. They are putting two ideas together
        with connectors.<br>

        Let’s start with these two sentences: She can’t whistle. Pete can’t whistle. How do you put them together?<br>

        Pete says, "She can’t whistle and I can’t either."<br>

        You can see we just add the conjunction “either” and take away the verb “whistle.” And Ashley says: "I don’t
        like ball sports and he doesn’t either!"<br>

        Keep looking for connectors!<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> You met someone, Anna? That’s great! What’s his name?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> His name? His name is uh… (stalling, looks around, sees a bus) Bus … ter. (stalling, looks around,
        sees a car) Car … ter.<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> (says it like Anna did) Bus...ter Car...ter?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> It’s just Buster Carter, Ashley. I like him and he likes me. We’re a great couple.<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> Hey, let’s all get dinner tonight, together. You can bring Buster.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> (laughing) Yeah, I can’t wait to meet him.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Thanks, Ashley, but he’s really busy tonight with his uh, (looks around, sees squirrel) squirrel
        collection. Bye, guys! Gotta go!<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> Squirrel collection?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> You know, she made all that up.<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> That’s so sad. She needs to meet someone. Hey, do you know anyone who she might...<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> No.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> (to herself) Anna, Anna, you lied! You lied! Now, they think you have a boyfriend - with a squirrel
        collection. Here, squirrel. (throws food) Well, you need to tell them the truth. You don’t have a boyfriend.<br>

        <b>Man:</b> Excuse me, is this seat taken?<br>

        (Anna shyly shakes head “no”)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Ashley, Pete, I need to talk to you. This morning, I lied.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Let me guess. There’s no Buster Carter. What a surprise!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I’m sorry. But later I really did meet someone and we have a lot in common!<br>

        He’s good at flying kites and so am I.<br>

        He likes to read comics and so do I.<br>

        I can play the ukulele and so can he.<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> He sounds perfect for you, Anna. Can he come tonight?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> That’s the sad part. You see, he just got a job as a spy, and tonight he leaves on assignment.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Of course he does.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> But that's okay, because now I know that there is someone out there made for me. (looks at the
        time) Oh, it’s late! I have to see him off at the train station. Bye, you guys!<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> Bye Anna! Oh dear, she’s worse than we thought.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> She’s lost her mind.<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> What should we do?<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> (happy, excited) Let’s tell her!<br>

        (Pete goes to leave but Ashley pulls him back.)<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> No, Pete. Mr. Right may not be real but he makes her really happy.<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> Did you find any other connectors? Notice how the words are in a different order in the
        part after “so.” "I am" becomes "am I" and "he can" becomes "can he."<br>
        "He’s good at flying kites and so am I. I can play the ukulele and so can he."
