       <b> Anna:</b> Hi there! Washington, D.C. has <i>many fun places to eat</i>. But, sometimes it's more fun to cook. In fact, tonight Marsha and I are cooking for friends. Well, she is cooking. I am doing the shopping.<br>
        (phone rings) It’s Marsha. Hi, Marsha.<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Hi, Anna. Do you have <i>the shopping list?</i><br>
       <b> Anna:</b> Yes, I told you: I have the shopping list. Can you hear it?<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Okay, good. I hear the list. Anna, please buy all the ingredients on the list.<br>
       <b> Anna:</b> Yes, Marsha, I will.<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> And <i>do not spend too much time shopping.</i><br>
       <b> Anna:</b> No, Marsha, I won’t. See you later.<br>
       <b> Anna:</b> Sometimes, Marsha worries too much. I love shopping! And, I did not spend too much money. Oh, no! But I did spend too much time! I have to return home now!<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Anna, what took you so long? Our guests <i>will be here soon!</i><br>
       <b> Anna:</b> Don’t worry, Marsha. I bought everything on the list.<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Let me see. You bought <i>a bunch of bananas,</i> <i>a box of pancake mix,</i> a bag of coffee … Anna, this is all wrong!<br>
       <b> Anna:</b> What do you mean wrong? I bought <i>a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread</i> … no, wait … two loaves of bread.<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Anna, these are the wrong <i>ingredients!</i><br>
       <b> Anna:</b> These ingredients are all on the list! I took this list from the counter.<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Anna, this is the shopping list for breakfast. I said, take the shopping list - on the <i>refrigerator - for dinner!</i><br>
       <b> Anna:</b> Marsha, there was no shopping list - on the refrigerator - for dinner!<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Oh no! It’s on the floor!!<br>
        Anna/<b>Marsha:</b> Ahh!!! Ahh!!!<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> What are we going to do?<br>
       <b> Anna:</b> When do our guests arrive?<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> They arrive in 30 minutes!<br>
       <b> Anna:</b> I can fix this. Do you trust me?<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Do I have to?<br>
       <b> Anna:</b> Yes.<br>
