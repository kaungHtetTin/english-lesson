        <b>Anna:</b> Hello! Washington, D.C. sits on the Potomac River. This river is important to the history and culture of the city. Today, I am at <i>an outdoor seafood market</i> near the Potomac River. Some say it is the oldest outdoor seafood market in the United States! I am here to buy seafood. Let’s see what they have!
        <b>Anna:</b> Excuse me. Can you help me?<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Sure! What do you need?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Pete!<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Anna!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> What are you doing here?<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> I work here. You know, it’s not easy <i>to be a writer.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yeah, I heard that. Sorry.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> But this job is great. I work outside by the river. And I can eat all the free seafood I want!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> That is great, Pete. In fact, I am here to buy <i>some seafood for my dinner party.</i><br>
        <b>Pete:</b> You came to the right place. They have the <i>freshest</i> seafood in town. How much money can you spend?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I can only spend $50.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Okay. What do you want?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> First, I want to buy <i>some shrimp.</i><br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Sure thing. Follow me. How much shrimp do you want?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> How much do I need for five people?<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> (yells to co-worker) Give her a pound of shrimp!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Ok, now I want <i>to buy some crabs.</i><br>
        <b>Pete:</b> The crabs here are delicious! They are the best because they come from the nearby Chesapeake Bay!<br> Walk this way.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> How many crabs do you want?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I want <i>a dozen crabs.</i><br>
        <b>Pete:</b> You should get the larger crabs. They have the most meat.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Then I want a dozen large crabs, please!<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Is that everything you need?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Let’s see … I have shrimp and crabs. And a friend is bringing a salad and <i>many ears of corn-on-the-cob.</i><br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Is that all the seafood that you need?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> That’ll be <i>$49.95.</i> <i>Cash or credit?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Credit, please.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Anna, you love to eat seafood. Did you grow up on the water?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No, I didn’t. But I love the water. And I love <i>being on the water.</i><br>
        <b>Pete:</b> You know how to sail?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Well … this afternoon I am going on a boat.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> You are full of surprises. What kind of boat? Is it a <i>motorboat or a sailboat?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> It’s a special boat, Pete. Well, thanks for your help. See you later!<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> See you, Anna! Wow, Anna’s a sailor! Who knew?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes, rivers are important to the history and culture of Washington, D.C. And now I am part of <i>this city’s interesting waterfront culture.</i> Until next time!<br>
