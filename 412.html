        <b>ASHLEY:</b> Anna, where are you going in such a hurry?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Hi, Ashley. The nurse’s office. Today I get the results from my blood test.<br><br>
        
        <b>ASHLEY:</b> I’m sure you’re fine. Don’t worry.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> You know, I used to dream of being a nurse. It is such an honorable career. Is there something you’ve dreamed of doing?<br><br>
        
        <b>ASHLEY:</b> Sure! I would love to be a dog trainer. Actually, I’ve taught my dog, Dublin, lots of tricks!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Well, I’m off to the nurse. Bye, Ashley.<br><br>
        
        <b>ASHLEY:</b> Bye, Anna.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Bye, Dublin.<br><br>
        
        (Anna stands near the nurse’s office and listens to her phone call.)<br><br>
        
        <b>NURSE:</b> I’m looking at her test results and they’re not good. In fact, I’m afraid she’s not going to make it.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> What?! I'm not going to make it? I'm dying??<br><br>
        
        <b>NURSE:</b> Anna, come in. How are you?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I guess..not so good. I’m dying!?<br><br>
        
        <b>NURSE:</b> What are you talking about?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I just heard you on the phone. Just tell me: How much longer do I have?<br><br>
        
        <b>NURSE:</b> I wasn't talking about you. A student of mine didn’t do well on her science test. So, she won’t be able to make it ... to graduation.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Whew. Thank goodness! For a minute, my whole life passed before my eyes. There are so many things I haven't done yet.<br><br>
        
        <b>NURSE:</b> Well, life is short. It’s important to do something you love every day.<br>
        <b>ANNA:</b> I couldn’t agree more.<br><br>
        
        <b>NURSE:</b> Now, let’s talk about your blood test. Your cholesterol is really low.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Awesome!<br><br>
        
        (Next, Anna is sitting in a sound studio with Jonathan.)<br><br>
        
        <b>JONATHAN:</b> Okay, Anna, say something and I’ll check your sound level.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Testing 1, 2, 3. Testing. Jonathan, I’ve been wondering something: What’s at the top of your bucket list?<br><br>
        
        <b>JONATHAN:</b> That’s easy. I’d love to win the World Karaoke Contest.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> This is so strange. I just saw on Twitter that they are having auditions in D.C. this weekend!<br><br>
        
        <b>JONATHAN:</b> Are you serious? Can you read the story by yourself?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Sure, absolutely.<br><br>
        
        <b>JONATHAN:</b> Thanks!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> You go.
        <br><br>
        (Anna goes outside and talks to Penelope.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Penelope, I was wondering if you still dream of being a dancer.<br><br>
        
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Only every day!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Well, guess what: A famous dancer is having a flash mob around the corner! Hundreds of people are dancing together!<br><br>
        
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> No way!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Way! If you leave right now, you can join them! Bye!<br><br>
        
        (Anna then sits with Pete in the office kitchen.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Pete, what’s one of your dreams?<br><br>
        
        <b>PETE:</b> Well, last night I dreamt I was in a spaceship. I was flying through outer space with these two beautiful...<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Pete -- not that kind of dream. I mean your hopes for the future.<br><br>
        
        <b>PETE:</b> Oh. I plan on selling my book to Hollywood and becoming rich and famous.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> That’s going to be difficult.<br><br>
        
        <b>PETE:</b> It’s my agent! Hello? Uh-huh. Sure! I can be in Los Angeles tomorrow!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Well, good job, Anna! My work here is done … almost.<br><br>
        
        (Music plays as Anna talks to many more coworkers)<br><br>
        
        <b>MUSIC:</b> You can search but you won't find the answer without a dream. You can reach for the stars but you won't get there without a dream...without a dream.<br><br>
        
        (Then, Anna is sitting at her work desk.)<br><br>
        
        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> Anna, what’s going on? Where is everybody?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I don’t know. Maybe something is, uh, going around the office.<br><br>
        
        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> You mean germs? Anna, you’d better use some of this hand cleaner. You don’t want to get sick, too.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Right. Okay, thanks. Not germs – dreams, Ms. Weaver. Dreams.<br><br>
        
        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> What did you say, Anna?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Nothing. Nothing.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> We hope you have enjoyed Level 2 of Let’s Learn English. Everyone is following their dreams, big and small.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> What are your dreams? Our dream is for you to keep learning English! Thanks for watching.
