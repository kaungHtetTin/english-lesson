        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope, the Lincoln Memorial is coming up on your left!<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> You’re going to love my Lincoln Memorial Fun Fact!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Oh, please tell us!<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> On a wall inside the memorial, the word “FUTURE” was carved wrong! They carved “EUTURE”!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Well, we all make mistakes.<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> Yeah, but this mistake was carved in stone!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> You’re right. That is pretty bad. Here’s another dollar!<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> More fun facts, please! (Crossing the river) I love riding over bridges! The water looks so
        pretty from here!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope, this is amazing! A minute ago, we were riding along the river, and now we’re riding in
        the river! Awesome.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Hey, we’re passing by the Pentagon on our right!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope, you love riding over the water on a bridge. But I love riding under a bridge in a
        boat!<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Anna, look! An airplane is flying right over our heads!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Wow! This is the closest I’ve ever been to an airplane in flight. Well, I’ve been inside a flying
        airplane. But not outside of an airplane as it flies over my head!<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> And now we’re driving out of the water. I still can’t believe this thing drives and sails!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I know. It’s amazing.<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> After we ride along these railroad tracks, you’ll see my favorite part of the tour! The U.S.
        Treasury where they make money!<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> Look, the U.S. Capitol is coming up!<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> I have a great Fun Fact about the U.S. Capitol.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> What is it?<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> There are tunnels under the Capitol. They connect the Capitol and office buildings of lawmakers.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I bet they built them years ago for secret reasons!<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> No. The lawmakers did not want to walk around outside in bad weather.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Oh.<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> We’re back at Union Station!<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> Do you want to know a creepy Fun Fact about Union Station? (he points to Union Station)<br>

        <b>Penelope:</b> The creepier the better!<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> Many years ago, inside Union Station, there was a funeral home!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> A funeral home?! You mean, for dead people?!<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> Do you know another kind of funeral home?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> No!<br>

        <b>Boy:</b> Well, I’ve gotta run!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Thanks for giving us the great tour!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Captain, that was awesome! And your son is a great tour guide!<br>

        <b>Captain:</b> What son?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Him.<br>

        <b>Captain:</b> I’ve never seen that boy in my life! See ya, ladies!<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> I learned many new Fun Facts in this lesson. Did you learn about prepositions?<br>
