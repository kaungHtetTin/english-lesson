        <b>Anna:</b> Hello! I have great news. My best friend from my hometown is coming here -- to Washington, D.C.! I
        can’t wait to catch up with her! Oh! I gotta go. <i>Her train arrives in 10 minutes!</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Penelope!<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> Anna! I am really happy to see you!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Me too! How was your trip?<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> It was fine.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Let me <i>help you with your bags.</i><br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> I’m really excited to be in Washington, D.C.! I can’t wait to hear about … everything!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I have so much to tell you. Let’s go to my apartment. We can talk <i>over a hot cup of tea.</i><br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> I love your apartment building, Anna. <i>Is your rent expensive?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Well, I have a roommate. So, we split the rent.<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> Oh, that’s right. Is your roommate nice?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Marsha is the nicest person I know in this city. Sometimes she worries too much. And she says I’m
        the <i>messiest cook she knows.</i> But we are great roommates.<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> So, Anna, is it hard to make friends in D.C.?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> At first it was hard. But now, Marsha is a good friend. And there’s Pete. Of all the people I know
        in D.C., Pete is <i>the most serious and also the silliest.</i><br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> He sounds … interesting.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Jonathan and Ashley are two other good friends of mine. In the city, they are the <i>friendliest
            people</i> I know. They always help me when I need it.<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> Your friends sound great! So, tell me about your job.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I love my work! I make a children’s show called the “Time Traveling Treehouse.”<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> Anna, that is the best job for you! Do you remember when we were little? We played in that
        <i>old treehouse</i> behind my family’s house for hours!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I forgot about that! We thought it really time traveled! It is really good to talk to you. New
        friends are good. But old friends are the best.<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> I know. Our hometown isn’t the same now. You are not there.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No crying. No crying. Penelope, why don't you move here and live with me and Marsha?<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> Anna, I can’t <i>leave our hometown.</i> You forget -- I love my job, too.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I didn’t forget. You are <i>the most famous turkey farmer</i> I know!<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> Thanks, Anna.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Come on. Let’s go eat dinner at one of D.C.’s most famous restaurants.<br>
        <b>Penelope:</b> Awesome!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I have a great apartment. I love my work. And I have awesome friends. I am the luckiest woman in
        Washington, D.C.<br>
        (sound of thunder)<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Until next time?
