    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Anna learns that someone at work looks a lot like her. But, who is this person? And what happens when they
        finally meet?</p>

    <p>
        <b>ANNA:</b> This article is so interesting. Pete, listen to this: “Somewhere in the world there is someone who
        looks just like you.”<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> No one is this handsome.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Oh Pete, there's something between your teeth.<br><br>

        (Pete tries to clean his teeth.)<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> It is gone?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> No. No. It’s still there. There. You got it. But think of it: There could be two of us in the
        world!<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Two Annas?<br><br>

        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Two Annas? Today, we’re reviewing ways to describe and compare people. Keep watching for
        descriptions of people!<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Actually, Anna, maybe your silly article is right. Yesterday at work, I met a woman who looks just
        like you.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Really? Wait, are you making fun of me?<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Not this time.<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> She’s tall and has curly hair. But even her face looks like yours. I think she’s a career
        consultant.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> I bet she has a lot of great advice. I can’t wait to meet her.<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Yes, you can. I met her and she is very difficult.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Pete, she’s just new. We have to give her a chance. What’s her name?<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Evelyna or something like that. You can’t miss her. She always wears a hat.<br><br>

        <b>PENELOPE:</b> So, Anna, have you met the new consultant yet?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> No. But I’ve already heard. We look alike, don’t we?<br><br>

        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Yeah, but you don’t act alike. You’re much nicer than she is.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Maybe she gets nervous at new jobs. Or maybe she's shy. Let’s not judge, Penelope.<br><br>

        <b>PENELOPE:</b> She’s not nervous or shy. She’s mean.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> You know, we should get to know her better. Let’s invite her to lunch!<br><br>

        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Sorry but I’m busy that day.<br><br>

        (Penelope walks away. Anna yells after her.)<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Oh, that’s too bad. Hey, I haven’t picked a day yet!<br><br>

        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> So, did you find anything? Here are a few things I found: Anna uses the words “look alike” to
        talk about the new consultant. She says, “We look alike, don’t we?”<br><br>

        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Penelope uses “than” and the comparative adjective “nicer” to compare Anna with the new
        consultant. She says, “You’re much nicer than she is.” Keep watching for more!<br><br>

        (Anna and Pete are playing a game.)<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> This is going to be so much fun. Boy, I can't wait to play this game.<br><br>

        <b>EVILANA:</b> How much longer are you going to be?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> We’ll be just a minute …<br><br>

        (Anna turns around and sees her look-alike.)<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> You must be Evelana. I’m Anna. We are look-alikes!<br><br>

        <b>EVILANA:</b> No, we’re not. And my name is pronounced “Evil-ana.”<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Oh. This is going to be fun.<br><br>

        <b>EVILANA:</b> You had better hurry up. I need this room for a lecture. It’s called: "If You Want to Win,
        Others Must Lose." What is all this stuff, anyway?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> It’s a game. We’re going to play at lunch.<br><br>

        <b>EVILANA:</b> It’s a stupid child's game!<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> It's a fun game. But yes, it is for children.<br><br>

        <b>EVILANA:</b> Well, you may be childish but I’m not. And you look stupid with that thing on your head.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Well, you look serious with that look on your face. Come on, Pete. Let’s play somewhere
        else.<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Actually, I’m going to stay for Evilana’s lecture.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Fine. You can learn new ways to beat people.<br><br>

        <b>EVILANA:</b> He will. He will.<br><br>

        (Days later, Anna and Penelope are playing the game. Pete comes in. He has a problem with his eye.)<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Okay. Am I a food?<br><br>

        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Nope.<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Hey, do you guys have room for one more?<br><br>

        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Sure, Pete! Come on over. What happened to your eye?<br><br>

        <b>PETE:</b> Evilana “accidentally” hit me. And she didn’t even say sorry. She’s so mean!<br><br>

        <b>PENELOPE:</b> I told you so.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Here, Pete. Put on this headband. You’ll feel better. Penelope, you’re right. Evilana is an awful
        person!
        <br><br>
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> And violent. And now we have to work with her!<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Haven’t you heard? She’s gone! She was given another assignment.<br><br>

        <b>PENELOPE:</b> What assignment?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> I’m not sure. I think it has something to do with outdoors. Anyway, let’s play! Pete it’s your
        turn.

    <p><b>Test Yourself</b><br>
        How well do you know the grammar from Level 2? Test yourself!<br><br>

        In today's lesson, you saw examples of grammar from other lessons. Look for sentences in Lesson 26 that
        have:<br><br>

        -comparatives<br>
        -passive voice<br>
        -had better<br>
        -would rather<br>
        -conditionals<br>
        -tag questions<br>
        -say, tell, speak or talk<br>
        -Writing Practice<br>
        Today, you learned some new language for describing people.<br><br>

        We also reviewed comparative adjectives and sentences using the word than. For example, Penelope says, "You're
        much nicer than she is."<br><br>

        For more on comparatives, watch Lesson 5: Greatest Vacation.<br><br>

        Now, you try it!<br><br>

        Think of a person in your family, a friend or someone else. Then, describe the person. What do they look like?
        What do they act like?<br><br>

        Next, write a few sentences comparing yourself to that person with comparative adjectives and than. For example,
        "I'm taller than my friend."</p>
