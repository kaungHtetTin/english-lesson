        <b>Guy:</b> Hello. I'm Guy Newsman with News Channel XYZ. I’m here in Washington, D.C. at the scene of a
        crime.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> We are talking with this woman.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> She saw <i>the crime</i> during her lunch break. It looks like she hurt herself while she was trying
        to stop the crime.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Tell us your name.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hi, Guy. I'm Anna.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Anna, what did you see and <i>what happened to your arm?</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Guy, I was minding my own business. See, I work over there.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Um-hum<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I <i>left work</i> to get some lunch. Then suddenly, I heard a woman yelling. She was yelling like
        this ... “Help! Help!”<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Um-hum<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> <i>Two robbers</i> were grabbing her bag like this. She was hitting them <i>with her
            umbrella.</i><br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Is that when you hurt your arm?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No. At that time, I was not fighting the robbers.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Um-hum.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> See. I was too far away and I didn't have my own umbrella.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> So, what happened next?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> They grabbed her bag and ran away! So, I grabbed her umbrella and <i>ran after the robbers.</i><br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Then that is the time that you hurt your arm?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No. I was yelling, “Stop, robbers! Stop!” She was yelling, “Hey, come back with my umbrella!”<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Were you afraid?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I had no time to be afraid, Guy. Well, I had time while I was resting on a bench. I had a lot of
        time.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Then what happened?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> The robbers got on a bus. So, I ran after the bus.<br>
        <b> A VO:</b> While I was running, I <i>tripped and fell.</i><br>
        <b>Guy:</b> And that is the time that you hurt your arm?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No. While I was lying on the ground, someone stepped on my arm!<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Ouch. That’s too bad.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Yeah. And they didn’t apologize. Well, then the robbers got themselves kicked off the bus.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Why?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> They didn’t pay. You've got to pay when you get on a bus. The police came and took them away.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> And that’s when you hurt your arm!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Then, when did you hurt yourself?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Well, Guy, by this time, I was feeling very hungry. So, I went to my office to get a snack.<br>
        <b>C:</b> Anna, I'm calling for help right now.<br>
        <b>C:</b> (on the phone) Hello? Yes, please come right away. My co-worker is stuck <i>in a vending
            machine.</i><br>
        <b>Guy:</b> You hurt your arm in a vending machine buying a bag of chips?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I was really hungry and the bag was stuck. I had to -<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> That’s all from News Channel XYZ. This is Guy Newsman saying goodbye.<br>
        <b>Guy:</b> Okay, we have to find ourselves another story, guys.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Until next time! Hi Mom!
