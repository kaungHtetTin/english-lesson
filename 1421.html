        <b> Anna: </b> Hi there, Ashley! <br>
        <b> Ashley:</b> Anna! Hi! <i>Where are you going?</i>
            (Anna’s stomach growls loudly)<br>
        <b> Ashley:</b>What was that?<br>
        <b> Anna:</b> I’m hungry. When I’m hungry, I only want to eat junk food! But I know I should eat healthy food. So, I fight with
            myself. One side says, ‘You should eat healthy food.’ The other side says, ‘But I want to eat junk food!’<br>
        <b> Ashley:</b> Well, Anna, go to the Giant supermarket. You should be able to find all kinds of food there - for all of you.<br>
        <b> Anna:</b> <i>Good idea,</i> Ashley. See you later!<br>
        <b> Ashley: </b>'Bye, Anna.<br>
        <b> Anna:</b> Wow! <i>This supermarket is huge!</i> Look at all of these fruits and vegetables! I should eat more vegetables.<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> Good idea, Anna. <i>You must eat more vegetables</i> … like celery!<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> Celery?! Do you know what the web says about celery?<br>
        <b> Anna:</b> No, what?<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> “Celery is 95 percent water - 100 percent NOT ice cream. I love the web!”<br>
        <b> Healthy*:</b> Anna, you mustn’t eat junk food. Junk food will kill you.<br>
        <b> Junky*: </b><i>You are being silly.</i><br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> No, you are!<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> No, you are.<br>
        <b> Anna:</b> Will you two please be nice to each other? It is important to eat healthy foods. But, a little junk food will not
            kill me. Hmm, ice cream. <i>Ice cream does sound good</i>.<br>
        <b> Junky: </b>Take this cart to the frozen food aisle!<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> No wait, go back! Go back! We forgot fruit. Go back!!<br>
        <b> Anna:</b> Okay, we are in the frozen food aisle!<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> Mmm, ice cream!<br>
        <b> Healthy: </b>Mmm, frozen peas!<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> Nobody says, ‘Mmm, frozen peas. They say, ‘Mmm, ice cream!<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> Mmm, frozen peas!!<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> Mmm, ice cream!!<br>
        <b> Anna: </b>I am not going to tell you two again! <i>Stop fighting!</i><br>
        <b> Anna:</b> I smell fresh bread! I love the smells of a bakery!<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> Oh, Anna, let’s buy a fresh loaf of whole wheat, organic bread!<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> You don’t have to buy bread. Buy some donuts, Anna!<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> You mustn’t buy donuts. They are only fat and sugar.<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> Exactly! You know, you are really no fun at all.<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> And you must think having high cholesterol is fun.<br>
        <b> Junky:</b> Everyone likes donuts! That is why you don’t have friends!<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> And that is why your cholesterol is so high!<br>
        <b> Junky: </b>My cholesterol is none of your business!!<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b>And I have lots of friends!!<br>
        <b> Anna:</b> Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I am sick and tired of the both of you!!<br>
        <b> Anna: </b><i>I know what you two need!</i><br>
        <b> Junky:</b> Anna! What are you doing?<br>
        <b> Healthy:</b> <i>Put me down!</i><br>
        <b> Anna:</b> You two need to cool off!<br>
        <b> Anna:</b> I am going to go buy my healthy food and my junk food! Good bye!<br>
        <b> Anna: </b>Until next time …<br>
        <b> Note:</b> "Healthy" and "Junky" are Anna's thoughts about what she should eat.<br>
