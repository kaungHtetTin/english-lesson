        <b>Professor Bot:</b> In Part 1 of this two-part lesson, Ms. Weaver gave Anna and Pete an assignment. Ms. Weaver instructed them to do everything by themselves.<br>

        “Themselves” is a reflexive pronoun.<br>
        
        In today’s lesson, Ms. Weaver will look at Pete’s and Anna’s research. First, let’s see Pete’s experiment.<br>
        
        (Pete throws the bag of flour on his chair and throws many other things on his flour baby. Next, we see him outside enjoying ice-cream without his flour baby.)<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Okay, Pete, let me see your research first.<br>
        
        (Pete hands her a big binder filled with research.)<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> That’s a heavy binder. And you and your Baby look great.<br>
        
        <b>Pete:</b> Thanks, Ms. Weaver. We feel great!<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Anna. Anna, you’re next. Anna? Anna wake up!<br>
        
        (She wakes up but is very confused.)<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> I'm here, Baby! I’m here! I’m here! Here's your bottle.<br>
        
        (She accidentally squirts her bottle and milk goes everywhere.)<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Anna, you and your baby look awful. What happened?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Well, I took her everywhere. Everywhere. And I fed her every three hours. So, I haven’t slept since … what day is it?<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> It’s Friday. What happened there?<br>
        
        (Ms. Weaver points to a large bandage on Anna’s flour baby.)<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh, that. Oh, that. I was making myself a salad and had a little accident with a knife. I put my flour baby in front of me. And then I accidentally stabbed it. But I gave it First Aid!<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Is that a burn?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. Yes it is. While I was making myself dinner, I put Baby next to me. I accidentally knocked her into the sink. So I put her in the microwave to dry. That’s when she caught fire.<br>
        
        (Pete smiles, thinking he’s won.)<br>
        
        <b>Professor Bot:</b> Okay. So, we use a reflexive pronoun when it refers to the subject of a sentence or clause.<br>
        
        But we DON’T use a reflexive pronoun with prepositions of place.<br>
        
        Anna uses examples of both in one sentence: While I was making myself dinner, I put Baby next to me.<br>
        
        We use a reflexive pronoun in the first part of the sentence. “Myself” refers to the subject “I.”<br>
        
        But in the second part of the sentence, we don’t use a reflexive pronoun in the prepositional phrase. We use the pronoun “me.” Why? “next to” is a preposition of place.<br>
        
        (Back in the meeting room, we’re about to learn who won the parenting experiment. Pete is smiling, thinking he won.)<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Anna, Anna, you should be very proud of yourself.<br>
        
        <b>Pete:</b> Proud? She stabbed and burned her baby!! And she only did one page of research…and it’s covered in milk. Ew.<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Yes, Pete. But she followed instructions.<br>
        
        <b>Pete:</b> Hey, I did ...<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Please, Pete. Anna, I think your baby has lost some weight. Is there something else you want to share?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. I’d like to share … these! I made them myself this morning.<br>
        
        <b>Pete:</b> You baked your baby? You should be ashamed of yourself!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> I baked them at the end of the experiment, Pete. At that point, this was just a bag of flour.<br>
        
        <b>Pete:</b> It was always just a bag of flour!!<br>
        
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Pete, will you listen to yourself?! You sound crazy.<br>
        
        <b>Pete:</b> I sound crazy! This whole experiment was crazy!! She was the one who carried around and fed it and ...<br>
        
        (Anna puts a cookie into his mouth. He chews it and begins to smile.)<br>
        
        <b>Pete:</b> Mmm. That is good.<br>
        
        (They all agree and eat the cookies.)<br>
        
        <b>Professor Bot:</b> So, what have we learned? We’ve learned when to use reflexive pronouns and when not to.<br>

        <p>In last week's lesson, Professor Bot taught you when to use reflexive pronouns. This week, he teaches you when not to use them.<br>

            Now, you try it!<br>
            
            Use the Comments section below and tell us about a time when you did something yourself, or a person or people you know did something by himself, herself or themselves.<br>
            
            For example:<br>
            
            After the holiday dinner, I washed all of the dishes myself. ("I" is the subject and "myself" is the reflexive pronoun.)<br>
            
            Subjects and their reflexive pronouns:<br>
            
            I…myself<br>
            You…yourself<br>
            He…himself<br>
            Her…herself<br>
            One…oneself<br>
            It…itself<br>
            We…ourselves<br>
            You…yourselves<br>
            They…themselves<br>
            
            <b>Remember, do NOT use reflexive pronouns:</b><br>
            
            After prepositions of place:<br>
            
            <b>Ex:</b> I put Baby next to myself. (wrong)<br>
            I put Baby next to me. (right)<br>
            
            <b>Ex:</b> I put my flour baby in front of myself (wrong)<br>
            I put my flour baby in front of me. (right)<br>
            
            After these verbs: meet, feel, relax, concentrate:<br>
            
            <b>Ex:</b> They will meet themselves at The Studio next Friday. (wrong)<br>
            They will meet at The Studio next Friday. (right)<br>
            
            After verbs that describe things we normally do for ourselves, such as dress, shave and wash​:<br>
            
            <b>Ex:</b> Anna got dressed herself for a day with her new flour baby. (wrong)<br>
            Anna got dressed for a day with her new flour baby. (right)</p>
