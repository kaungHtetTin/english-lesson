    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Ms. Weaver gives Anna and Pete a new assignment: make a show about single parents. But first, she wants them to
        try out parenting for themselves...</p>
    <p>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Anna, Pete, I have a new assignment for you -- a show on single parents! What is it like for
        a mother or a father to raise a child by herself or himself?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> We can interview single parents. They can share their experiences themselves.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Yes, but you need to experience parenthood yourselves.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Ourselves?<br>

        <b>Peter:</b> Yeah, how do we do that? We’re not parents.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> I asked myself the same question. I said, "Caty, how are they gonna do that?" Then an idea
        came to me. I will give you the babies!<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> You may be asking yourself the same thing that I’m asking myself: what is Ms. Weaver
        talking about!? I am sure we will find out shortly.<br>

        This lesson teaches reflexive pronouns.<br>

        Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of a sentence or clause. We use them when the subject and the
        object are the same person or thing.<br>

        For example, Ms. Weaver says, “I asked myself the same question.”<br>

        “I” is the subject and “myself” refers back to it. Here, she would not use the pronoun “me.” You need to use the
        reflexive pronoun “myself.”<br>

        Reflexive pronouns are easy to find: they end in “self” or “selves.” I have a feeling we are going to see a lot
        of reflexive pronouns. Listen for them!<br>

        (Pete and Anna continue their meeting with Ms. Weaver. She puts two bags of flour on the table. Pete and Anna
        still look confused.)<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Here are your babies!<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Those are bags of flour.<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> No, Pete, for the next six days, this is your baby. Here are your instructions. Do not leave
        your babies alone. A baby cannot take care of itself. And you two must do everything by yourselves.<br>

        We will meet next Friday. Oh, and the person who does the best research will get an extra day of vacation. Help
        yourself to a baby.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Pete, look, my baby is organic and whole grain. Your baby is ordinary.<br>

        (Pete pushes her flour baby off desk.)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> (to Pete) Monster! (to Caty) This is a great idea, Ms. Weaver!<br>

        (Pete and Anna are now outside.)<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> This is a terrible idea.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Speak for yourself, Pete! We need to throw ourselves into the research! I’m starting right now!<br>

        (She leaves but forgets her Flour Baby.)<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Hey Anna, you forgot your baby!<br>

        (She turns and looks at Pete.)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Come to mama!<br>

        (The bag of flour flies at her. She catches it.)
        <br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Good girl! Good girl!<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> Singular reflexive pronouns end in “self.” Plural ones end in “selves.”<br>

        Anna says, “We need to throw ourselves into the research!” The subject “we” is plural. So, we must use the
        plural reflexive pronoun “ourselves.”<br>

        (The parenting research begins. Anna tries to open a baby stroller but can’t. A man walking by helps her. She
        pushes Flour Baby in the stroller but it falls out. On another day, she jogs with it. After several days, she is
        tired!)<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> This is hard! I hope Pete is not doing well. I really need that vacation day!<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> We will all see how Pete is doing in the next episode. We’ll also learn when not to use
        reflexive pronouns.

        talk about yourself, or maybe a friend or family member/s. What happened? How did it go?<br>

        <b>Using Reflexive Pronouns</b><br>

        We use reflexive pronouns when the subject and object of the sentence or clause are the same person or
        thing.<br>

        Ex: I asked myself the same question.<br>

        Subjects and their reflexive pronouns:<br>

        I…myself<br>
        You…yourself<br>
        He…himself<br>
        Her…herself<br>
        One…oneself<br>
        It…itself<br>
        We…ourselves<br>
        You…yourselves<br>
        They…themselves<br>

        A reflexive pronoun can be a direct object, indirect object or an object of the preposition.<br>

        <b>Direct Object:</b><br>
        Ex: A baby cannot take care of itself.<br>

        <b>Indirect Object:</b><br>
        Ex: I asked myself the same question.<br>

        <b>Object of the Preposition:</b><br>
        Ex: Anna and Pete are experiencing parenthood for themselves.<br>

        <b>To show emphasis:</b><br>

        Sometimes, we use reflexive pronouns simply to emphasize the person or thing in the sentence or clause. In this
        case, the reflexive pronoun often appears at the end of the sentence:<br>

        Ex: Anna took care of the baby herself.<br>
        <b>We do NOT use reflexive pronouns:</b><br>

        After prepositions of place<br>

        Ex: Anna found the flour baby in the kitchen herself. (wrong)<br>
        Anna found the flour baby in the kitchen. (right)<br>

        After these verbs: meet, feel, relax, concentrate<br>

        Ex: They will meet themselves at The Studio next Friday. (wrong)<br>
        They will meet at The Studio next Friday. (right)<br>

        After verbs that describe things we normally do for ourselves, such as dress, shave and wash​<br>

        Ex: Anna got dressed herself for a day with her new flour baby. (wrong)<br>
        Anna got dressed for a day with her new flour baby. (right)<br>
