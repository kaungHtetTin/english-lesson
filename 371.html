        <b>Anna:</b> It is no secret that Washington, D.C. has spies. Well, it should be a secret because spying is secret. But it’s not a secret. There’s even a spy museum! The International Spy Museum has created an amazing collection of spy things! And today, we will see them! My boss, Ms. Weaver, has sent me here … on a mission!<br>

        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Hello, Anna, are you there?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> That’s her. Yes, Agent Peacock. This is Agent Flamingo, <i>reporting for duty.</i><br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Agent what? Look, Anna … I mean, Agent Flamingo, I want you to learn all <i>you can about spying.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> You mean, <i>collect intelligence?</i><br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Yeah, it’s for our new show -- “D.C. Secrets.”<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> You've got it, Agent Peacock. The mission is safe with me.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Oh, okay, great. Just be back by noon.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Agent Peacock, I’m at an air duct!<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Yes, spies sometimes <i>sneak down air ducts.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> I have never <i>snuck down an air duct.</i> It’s dark and small. I’m afraid of dark, small places.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> You can do it, Agent Flamingo. You know, spies aren’t afraid of a little darkness.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Right. It’s just an air duct -- a dark, small air duct. Okay. I’m doing it, Agent Peacock! I am sneaking down a long, dark, small air duct. I’m having <i>a little trouble breathing.</i><br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Just keep going, Agent Flamingo. Think of the team!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Okay, I will think of the team. I’m thinking of the team, Agent Peacock! I did it! I did it! I sneaked down an air duct. That was <i>a little uncomfortable.</i><br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Good!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> What's the next mission?<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Umm … have you ever cracked a code?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Well, go learn. Spies use their brains.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Got it! I’ve never cracked a code before. Let’s try, Agent Flamingo! This is really hard. I'm still trying <i>to crack the code.</i> I've cracked the code! I've cracked the code, Agent Peacock! My brain really hurts.<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Great. Umm, Agent Flamingo, now answer this question: Do spies have to be in good shape?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> “Yes,” Agent Peacock! Spies have to be in really good shape! Can you hear me?<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> You’re breaking up, Flamingo.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> The International Spy Museum is awesome! Agent Peacock, I completed the mission!<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Great. Great. Now, I have another very important mission for you.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Got it. See you back at H.Q.!<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Yummy! You brought my lunch! Thanks, Agent Flamingo!<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Mission completed. Agent Peacock!<br>
        (Amelia makes a face.)<br>
        <b>Ms. Weaver:</b> Don't ask.<br>
        Special thanks go out to the International Spy Museum for letting us film in the museum!
