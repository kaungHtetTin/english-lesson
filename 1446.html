    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Anna loses her key. When she goes looking for it, she finds a life coach instead. And that's where the confusion
        begins...</p>
    <p>
        <b>Anna:</b> Hi, Kaveh! Let’s go to lunch!<br>

        <b>Kaveh:</b> Ooh, I know a great place. When I first started working here, I would go every day!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Great. Oh, no.<br>

        <b>Kaveh:</b> What’s wrong?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I lost my key! I just had it this morning.<br>

        <b>Kaveh:</b> You should check the Lost & Found office.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Great idea. Where is it?<br>

        <b>Kaveh:</b> Oh, it used to be across from the cafeteria. But now it’s down in the basement next to the
        elevators. It’s really hard to find.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> The Lost & Found is hard to find. That’s funny.<br>

        <b>Kaveh:</b> It is.<br>

        <b>Professor Bot:</b> I hope Anna can find the Lost & Found office!<br>

        Used to and would describe something that happened repeatedly in the past.<br>

        Kaveh uses would when he says, “When I first started working here, I would go every day!<br>

        There are two differences between used to and would.<br>

        <b>Number 1:</b> We use would only when we say the time period first.<br>

        <b>Number 2:</b> For verbs like be, think, feel, see and understand, we can only use used to.<br>

        Kaveh says, "It used to be across from the cafeteria."<br>

        Keep listening for more!<br>

        (A worker moves the sign for the Lost & Found office. So, Anna walks into the wrong office without knowing
        it.)<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> Come in! I am Serenity.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Hi, Serenity. I’m Anna!<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> Please, sit down. How can I help you?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I lost something very important.<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> Shh. I already know. You need help.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. I need help finding the key …<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> Shh. You need to find the key – the key that will give you happiness.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Yes. Finding this key will make me very happy.<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> First, Anna, let me tell you a little bit about myself.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Okay.<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> I used to be a very important person with a very important job. I made a lot of money -- I mean
        a lot.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Wow. Good for you!<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> No! No, it was bad for me. I lost the most important thing – the key! You’ve lost it too,
        haven’t you, Anna? Haven’t you?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I guess. So, how does this work? Do I have to fill out a form or something?<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> No. No forms. Just answer this one question: As a child, what did you use to do to feel
        happy?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> When I was little, I used to sing all the time with my family. Those were good times.<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> Singing is so joyful! I used to sing. But now that I’ve started my business, I’ve just been too
        busy. Too busy! Anna, why don’t you sing again?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I sing everywhere! I sing in the office. I sing on the metro. I sing in the elevators. I sing on
        the escalators. I sing in the bathroom. Serenity! Serenity! I really need to find my key. Yeah!<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> Yes, we need to find the key … the key to happiness.<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> No, no. I just need to find the key to my apartment.<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> I used to know. But now I don't! Do you, Anna?<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> I don’t know. I think I left it in the ladies’ room. You know, this isn’t the Lost & Found, is
        it?<br>

        (Anna starts walking out of the room)<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> It could be the Lost & Found. I’m lost! And I used to find joy for people! I used to find
        joy!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> You know, this is a bad time for you. I’ll find the Lost & Found myself. Bye, thanks.<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> I used to find joy. I used to find joy! I used to find joy!<br>

        <b>Anna:</b> Ah, I found my key!<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> I used to find joy!<br>

        <b>Pofessor Bot:</b> Oh no. Serenity lost her joy. But at least Anna found her key! Check out our website for

    <p style="color: rgb(40, 156, 252);font-weight: 1000;">Practice</p>
    <p>
        Now, practice the grammar you just learned. Use the Comments section below to tell us what you used to do to
        feel happy.<br>

        Remember to follow these rules:<br>

        <b>Rule # 1:</b> Use would only when you introduce the time period first.<br>

        You can mention the time in the same sentence:<br>

        "When I first started working here, I would go every day!"<br>

        Or, you can mention the time in the previous sentence:<br>

        "When I first started working here, I did not bring lunch from home. I would go to restaurants every day.<br>

        <b>Rule # 2:</b> For stative verbs, only use used to. A stative verb is a verb used mainly to describe a state
        or situation rather than an action.<br>

        Two examples from today's lesson:<br>

        <b>Serenity:</b> "I used to know. But now I don't"<br>

        <b>Kaveh:</b> "It used to be across from the cafeteria.<br>

        There are many stative verbs in English. Some examples include: be, know, think, feel, see, understand, want,
        like, love, hate, wish, mean, remember, taste, believe, hear, look and seem.
