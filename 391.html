        <b>Anna:</b> Hi Ashley!<br>

        <b>Ashley:</b> Hey, Anna! How was your weekend?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> It was great! I went to the D.C. State Fair.<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> I would have gone, but I was busy. How was it?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> It was awesome! I won first place in a pet contest!<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> But, you don’t have a pet, do you?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes and no. What do you mean by “pet”?<br>
        
        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> A pet is an animal that lives with you. People love their pets. "Ashley said, you don’t have a pet, do you? She used a tag question, a small question at the end of a sentence. Let's look for more of them!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Look, a pet! Who’s this cute little dog?<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> Oh, right. You haven’t met my dog, have you? This is Dublin.<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Hi, Dublin! Nice to meet you. He’s so cute!<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> Thanks! So, tell me about the state fair.<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh, there were the usual things -- fair food, cute babies, music. But there must have been a dozen different contests! And some were pretty strange.<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> There was a contest to see who could spit a watermelon seed the farthest. You should have seen all the people who wanted to spit a watermelon seed! And, it was pretty fun to watch. But Ashley, the pet contests were the best. There was a pet parade. Lots of people walked with their dogs.<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> That sounds so fun. But Anna, tell me, how did you win a pet contest without a pet?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Okay, the closest thing I have is my pet rock.<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> I know it’s silly, but I’ve had it since I was a little girl. So, for a joke, I brought it to the fair. But then I was invited to enter the “One-of-Kind Pet” contest. And I won! (holds up first place ribbon)<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> Anna, only you could have won a pet contest with a pet rock. I should have brought Dublin. He would’ve won a contest!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> It’s not very easy to win one of these. (shows her the blue ribbon) Does he have a costume?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> They had a costume contest. You should have seen this little girl. She and her dog wore matching princess costumes!<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> Dublin doesn’t wear costumes.<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Does he know any tricks?<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> Come this way. Now, watch this. (Dublin chases a toy)<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> You caught it, Dublin! And you killed it! Good dog! Ashley, he could have won the Best Catch contest! Aw, good boy! Ashley, pets are fun, aren’t they?<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> Yes. And they become part of your family. (she drinks from her Dublin mug)<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Ashley, I think I want a dog. No. I know I want a dog!<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> It’s a big responsibility. You may want to spend time with a dog first.<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> That is a great idea. But where can I find a dog?<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> You know, Anna, I have some shopping to do. Do you want to watch Dublin for a couple of hours?<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Yes! I would! I will take very good care of him!<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> I know you will. Here’s his leash.<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Thank you.<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> (to Dublin) Okay, I'll miss you!<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Aw. I don’t want you to be lonely. Here, Rocky can stay with you. (puts pet rock on wall)<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> Anna, I really don’t need … Okay. Thanks, Anna.<br>
        
        <b>Anna:</b> Sure. Bye, Ashley. (to Dublin) Come on, Dublin! Bye, Rocky!<br>
        
        <b>Ashley:</b> Bye!<br>
        
        <b>Prof. Bot:</b> Anna’s rock is cute, isn’t it? Oh, there is another tag question! You found some more, didn’t you?<br>
        
        You haven’t met my dog, have you?<br>
