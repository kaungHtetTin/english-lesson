        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Hey, Anna. What are you reading?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> I’m reading about fire safety. Ms. Weaver named me fire safety monitor.<br><br>
        
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> But the only time we have a fire emergency is when someone burns a piece of toast.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> That is true. But fire safety is very serious – very serious. If there is a fire emergency, I have to help everyone out of the building.<br><br>
        
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Well then, if I were you, I’d learn as much as possible.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> You’re right. And I know just who to call!<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Hmm, I wonder where Anna’s going. Today we are reviewing conditionals and learning helpful language for emergencies.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> If Anna studies hard, she’ll be a great fire safety monitor! That’s a conditional. It uses “if” to show that something is true only when something else is true.
        <br><br>
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Let’s find out where Anna is going. And if you want to learn fire emergency language, keep watching!<br><br>
        
        (Two firefighters welcome Anna to their firehouse.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Hi, Firefighter Jones.<br><br>
        
        <b>FIREFIGHTER JONES:</b> Hey, how are you, Anna?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I’m well, thanks. How are you? Hi, Firefighter Hatcher.<br><br>
        
        <b>FIREFIGHTER HATCHER:</b> Hi, Anna. How are you?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I’m well, thanks.<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> Welcome to our firehouse.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Thank you.<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> Come on in.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Thanks.<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> This is where the firefighters eat. This is where we rest. This is where we exercise. This is where the firetrucks are parked and maintained.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> This place is beautiful.<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> You know, the firehouse is a firefighter’s second home.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Firefighter Jones, Firefighter Hatcher: Can you tell me some ways to prepare for a fire emergency?<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> Sure, Anna. There’s one really important thing you can do: Install a fire alarm. Test it monthly and make sure the batteries are fully charged.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Let’s talk about those emergency exits.<br><br>
        
        <b>FF J:</b> In your home, office and schools, know where your emergency exits are located.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> What about fire extinguishers?<br><br>
        
        <b>FF J:</b> Everyone should know how to use a fire extinguisher. Have one handy and practice using it.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> What if we need to get out?<br><br>
        
        <b>FF J:</b> You should have an evacuation plan. And practice getting out safely with fire drills.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> If I am in a building and it’s on fire, should I use the elevator?<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> No. Always use the stairs.
        <br><br>
        <b>ANNA:</b> What other safety tips should I know?<br><br>
        
        <b>FF J:</b> Stay low. Smoke rises. The air is clearer close to the ground.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Stay low. Anything else?<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> If you touch a door and it’s hot, don’t open it. There might be a fire on the other side.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> What do I do if my clothes catch on fire?<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> Do not run. If you run, the fire will burn faster. You must stop, drop and roll.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Thanks so much! I’ve learned a lot. And I can’t wait to share this information with others.<br><br>
        
        <b>FF H:</b> Thanks for coming, Anna.<br><br>
        
        <b>FF J:</b> It’s been a pleasure meeting you.<br><br>
        
        (Anna is back at the office talking to Penelope.)<br><br>
        
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> So, Anna, how was the visit to the fire station?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I learned a lot! And firefighters have a very difficult job.<br><br>
        
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Do you smell smoke?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> No. So, like I was saying, I learned how to …<br><br>
        
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> Anna, I smell smoke.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> If you smell smoke, call the fire department!<br><br>
        
        (Anna begins to evacuate her coworkers.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> If you smell smoke, get out of the building. Come on people, we have a fire emergency! Leave your things and evacuate calmly and quickly. Very good. Very good.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> We have a fire emergency. No, take the stairs Let’s get out. Let’s get out safely.<br><br>
        
        (Anna and coworkers stand outside of the building.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> We got out in less than 6 minutes! Good job, people! Wait. Where’s Pete?<br><br>
        
        <b>PENELOPE:</b> I know where he is. I’ll go get him.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> No! Never go back into a burning building! The fire department is coming. Stay calm, Pete. Help is on the way! Help is on the way!
