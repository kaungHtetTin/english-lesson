        <b>ANNA:</b> Hi! I see you like superhero culture. Me too.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> In fact, tonight I’m going to the big superhero convention. Are you going?<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> Um, I don’t know.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ANNA:</b> Well, you'd better decide soon. Last year, it sold out.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> So, since we’re talking about superheroes: would you rather become a superhero by accident, like Spiderman, or be born a superhero, like Wonder Woman?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Take your time. It’s a big question. I thought about it for days –<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> Okay. If I had to choose, I’d rather be born a superhero.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I’d rather become a superhero by an unexpected accident!<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> Aren’t all accidents unexpected?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Well, yeah.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> What was that!? Are you okay?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I'm better than okay. I feel super!<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Oh No! Anna was just hit by lightning. She had better get help.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> We use had better to give advice. It is very informal and stronger than should and ought to. For example, Anna says: “You'd better decide soon. Last year, it sold out.”<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> When we use had better, we usually shorten the word had for personal pronouns.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> We use would rather to say what we or someone else prefers to do or have. For example, the boy says: “Okay. If I had to choose, I’d rather be born a superhero.<br><br>
        
        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> With would rather, we also shorten the word would when used with personal pronouns. Keep watching and listen for had better and would rather.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> You’d better see a doctor.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I’ve never felt better!<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> You were just struck by lightning!! And what happened to your hair and your clothes?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I don't know. Wait, I do know. This is my super suit! And this is my origin story.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> What are you talking about?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> An origin story tells the beginning of a superhero. You should know that.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> You're not making any sense, lady.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> I would rather be called Lightning Bolt Lady! It’ll sound great in a theme song: Lightning Bolt Lady!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Now, I need to find my superpowers --<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> Um, I really think --<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Wait. Don’t tell me. I’ll read your mind. You are thinking you’d like to be my super helper.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> I was not thinking that.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> ... that you’d like to live in a treehouse.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> No.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> … that you should eat more vegetables.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> Please, stop talking. You really should get some help.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Mind reading is not my superpower. Maybe I can become invisible. I … am … invisible!<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> You can’t see me. Who am I? I’m not here. You can’t see me.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> I can see you and so can everybody else.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> No power of invisibility. Maybe I can create a force field. I feel it working. Nothing can hurt –<br><br>
        
        (Someone throws a piece of paper and it hits her head.)<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Ow, that wasn’t very nice. I see I have a lot of work to do. Well, goodbye, non-super person!<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> Wait. I’d better go with you. You might get worse…if that’s even possible.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> That's very nice of you, ordinary human. But I’d rather go by myself. This is a quest.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> Every time you speak, I get more confused.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> A quest is a part of all superhero stories. You really need to work on your superhero studies. Now, stand back. I’ve never flown before.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> And you’re not flying now.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNA:</b> Flying is also not my superpower. That’s too bad. It's going to be expensive to Uber everywhere. You know, I'd rather walk. It’s a nice day. Goodbye, non-super person.<br><br>
        
        <b>YOUNG MAN:</b> I am not talking to strangers again.<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNOUNCER:</b> Will Lightning Bolt Lady find her superpowers … ever? Ouch! Did that brick wall hurt? Will the young man ever talk to a stranger again?<br><br>
        
        <b>ANNOUNCER:</b> Find out on the next episode of Let’s Learn English!

        <p>Now, you try it!<br><br>

            First, read about had better and would rather below. Then, write one sentences using each.<br><br>
            
            Use had better to give Anna advice about being a superhero<br>
            Use would rather to tell us what superpowers you prefer<br>
            For example, "I would rather be able to fly than make a force field."<br><br>
            
            <b>Had Better / Would Rather</b><br>
            We use the modal had better to give advice and would rather to tell someone about preferences.<br><br>
            
            When you see a pronoun with 'd after it, the 'd can be short for either had or would. For example, sometimes I'd means I had. Other times, I'd it means I would. Read more below.<br><br>
            <b>Had Better</b><br>
            
            We use had better to give advice. It is stronger than should and ought to. It tells us that there may be consequences if a person doesn’t take the advice.<br><br>
            
            Examples:<br><br>
            
            You had better decide soon. Last year, it sold out.<br>
            (Consequence: The conference might sell out.)<br><br>
            
            Anna had better be careful with her superpowers!<br>
            (Consequence: Someone could get hurt.)<br>
            The verb form is always had (not have) and we use a simple verb after had better. We also usually shorten had with personal pronouns:<br><br>
            
            I’d / you'd / he'd / she'd / we'd / they'd better…
        <br>
    <table>
        <tr><td>subject</td>
        <td>had better</td>
        <td>simple verb</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I</td>
        <td>‘d better</td>
        <td>go</td></tr>
        <tr><td>You</td>
        <td>‘d better</td>
        <td>see</td></tr>
    </table><br>
    Sometimes, we use had better to show urgency. This is a more polite way to use it.<br><br>

Examples:<br><br>

I’d better go with you. You might get worse.<br>
(Urgency: You might really need help.)<br><br>

You'd better see a doctor.<br>
(Urgency: You are hurt and must see a doctor.)<br>
<b>Would Rather</b><br><br>

We use would rather to say what someone prefers to do or have. It is very common in spoken English.<br><br>

We also shorten the word would with personal pronouns: I'd / you'd / he'd / she'd / we'd / they'd rather…<br>
<table>
    <tr><td>subject</td>
    <td>would rather</td>
    <td>simple verb</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I</td>
    <td>‘d rather</td>
    <td>be born</td></tr>
    <tr><td>She</td>
    <td>‘d rather</td>
    <td>become</td></tr>
</table>
<br>We also use would rather to say what one person prefers some other person do. When we do this, the subject and object are different.<br>
<table>
    <tr><td>subject</td>
    <td>would rather</td>
    <td>object</td>
    <td>past participle</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The young man</td>
    <td>would rather</td>
    <td>Anna</td>
    <td>left</td></tr>
</table><br>
When we compare two or more things in the same sentence, we use the word than.<br>
<table>
    <tr><td>first thing</td>
    <td>than</td>
    <td>second thing</td></tr>
    <tr><td>I would rather be born a superhero</td>
    <td>than</td>
    <td>become one by accident.</td></tr>
</table><br>
For questions, notice that the subject comes between would and rather. Example: Would you rather be able to fly or make a force field?<br><br>

<b>Test Yourself</b><br>
How well do you know the grammar from Level 2? Test yourself!<br><br>

In Lesson 24, you will see examples of grammar that you have learned in Level 2. Look for sentences in Lesson 24 with:<br><br>

-Passive voice<br>
-Prepositions<br>
-Reflexive pronouns<br>
-Any grammar from Lessons 1 - 23<br>
Then, write those sentences in the Comments section. For example: Passive Voice: Aren't all accidents unexpected?
