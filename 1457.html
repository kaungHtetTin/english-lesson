    <p><b>Summary</b></p>
    <p>Anna visits a friend on her houseboat. She says she wants to live on one. But, is that really a good idea?</p>

    <p>
        <b>ANNA:</b> Hello, Ms. Weaver!<br><br>

        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> Oh, Anna. I’ve invited some people to dinner Saturday. We’re going to that new seafood
        restaurant -- Fish on a Dish.<br><br>

        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> Why don’t you join us? My treat.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Thanks, Ms. Weaver. But I already have plans. My friend has invited me to her houseboat.<br><br>

        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> Houseboat, really? That’s unique.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Yes, it is. In fact, I’m thinking of living on a houseboat.<br><br>

        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> Aren’t you too tall and klutzy to live on a houseboat?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> I am not too tall!<br><br>

        (She knocks over a display board.)<br><br>

        <b>PROF. BOT VO:</b> Is Anna really ready for a houseboat?<br><br>

        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Ms. Weaver invited Anna to dinner. When we make friendly, informal invitations, we use phrases
        like “Why don’t…?”<br><br>

        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> For example, Ms. Weaver said, “Why don’t you join us? My treat!” That’s: Why don’t plus the
        subject plus the simple form of the verb.<br><br>

        <b>PROF. BOT:</b> Anna responded to the invitation by saying, “Thanks, but I already have plans.” Keep watching
        for more examples of informal invitations!<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> Anna, I’m so glad you could come!<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Hi, Fanny!<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> Hi, this is my son, Phoenix.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Hi, Phoenix.<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> How about you give Anna a tour and I will make some lunch?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> Aye, aye, captain!<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> Great!<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Do you really call her “captain”?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> I kind of have to.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> So, Phoenix, I think I’d like to live on a houseboat. Do you like living here?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> I love it! It’s much different than living in a house.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Oh, I bet. I bet you had to get rid of a lot of stuff, didn’t you?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> No way! We moved from a 3-story house to a boat! So, we really had to downsize!<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> I’d have to get rid of a lot of stuff. I have a rock collection and I have some really big
        rocks.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Can you stop this boat from rocking for a minute?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> No. We’re floating on water. I can’t do that.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Well, since you live on the water, aren’t you afraid of great white sharks?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> No, not really. They don’t live in these waters.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> … that you know of. What about killer whales?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> No.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Electric eels?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> No.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Barracudas?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> No.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Piranhas?<br><br>

        <b>PHOENIX:</b> Uh-uh.<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> You know, Anna, if you’re afraid of sea life, maybe you shouldn’t live on a houseboat. Do you have
        any boating experience?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Oh, oh yeah, Fanny. I have battled the great waters before -- once on a swan boat and once in a
        duck boat ... bus. It was a boat that turned into a bus.<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> Yeah, I don’t think that counts.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Fanny, does this rocking ever bother you?<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> No, I love it. It goes up and down and side to side and up and down. Anna, I love it!<br><br>

        (Because of the rocking, Anna begins to feel seasick.)<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> Anna, are you feeling okay?<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Yeah, yeah. You know, I just need some fresh air.<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> Let me open a window for you.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> No, I need some fresh land air. I mean, I need to breathe air on land. Oh, is that the time? I
        should really be going.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Thanks for lunch, Fanny, and a tour of your houseboat. It’s given me a great idea!<br><br>

        <b>FANNY:</b> You’re going to live on a houseboat?<br>
        <b>ANNA:</b> Sort of. Thanks again!<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Hi! How would you like to hang out on my boat? Great! See you then!<br><br>

        (Ms. Weaver and Anna sit in a boat on land.)<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> …and this is my shark net.<br><br>

        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> Thank you for the invitation, Anna.<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> Of course, would you like more orange juice?<br><br>

        <b>MS. WEAVER:</b> Uh..<br><br>

        <b>ANNA:</b> (to young man) Ahoy!

        <b>Writing Practice</b><br><br>
        Now, you try it!<br><br>

        Try making invitations! Invite someone to an event or activity. Use the language you learned today. Write your
        invitations in the comments below.<br><br>

        For example: Why don't you come to gym with me?<br><br>

        In English, we make friendly, informal invitations using phrases like:​<br><br>

        Why don't + subject + simple verb<br>
        "Why don't you join us?" -Ms. Weaver​<br><br>

        How about + subject + simple verb<br>
        "How about you give Anna a tour...?" -Fannie​<br><br>

        Let's + simple verb<br>
        "Let's learn English!" -Anna​<br><br>

        How would you like to + simple verb<br>
        "How would you like to hang out on my boat?" -Anna<br><br>

        A few phrases for accepting are:<br><br>

        That’s a good/great idea!<br>
        That sounds good/great.<br>
        Thanks! I’d love to.<br><br>

        A few phrases for declining are:<br><br>

        Thanks, but I already have plans.<br>
        That’s a good idea but…<br>
        I’m not sure.<br><br>

        <b>Test Yourself</b><br>
        How well do you know the grammar from Level 2? Test yourself!<br><br>

        In today's lesson, you saw examples of grammar from other lessons. Look for sentences in Lesson 27 that
        have:<br><br>

        -passive voice<br>
        -conditionals<br>
        -tag questions<br>
        -adverb clauses<br>
        We also used many contractions -- the short forms of words. Find the contractions and write their meanings in
        the comments below.<br><br>

        For example, Anna says, "I think I’d like to live on a houseboat." (I'd is a contraction. It means I
        would.)<br><br>

        English contractions:<br><br>

        ’m = am<br>
        ’re = are<br>
        ’s = is and has<br>
        ’ll = will<br>
        ’ve = have<br>
        ’d = had and would<br>
    </p>
