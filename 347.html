        <b>Anna:</b> Hi, there! Washington, D.C. is a great place to work. Many people here work in government and politics. But there are many other jobs. You can work at <i>a hospital; a university.</i> You can work in a <i>coffee shop.</i> Wait a minute, I think I see a friend of mine. Pete? Is that you?<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Hi, Anna.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> You look different. <i>Your beard </i> … is really big.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> You don’t like it, do you?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No, no. You just look … different.<br>
        (To server) Thank you. So, what’s wrong? You look sad.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> I don’t <i>have a job.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Sorry, I can’t hear you.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> Tons of money? But I can’t code.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Next question. Can <i>you drive?</i><br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Do you mean drive a race car? It’s really hard to be a race car driver. First, you need a race car ...<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> No, I mean drive a taxi or drive a bus.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> No, I always <i>fall asleep when I drive.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Oh, that’s not good. Next question. Can you teach? You can <i>be a teacher in a school</i>.<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> No, I cannot teach.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Can you cook? You can be a <i>chef in a restaurant.</i><br>
        <b>Pete:</b> No, I can’t code! I can’t teach! I can’t cook! Anna, I can’t do anything. This is sad. I’m gonna write about <i>my feelings in my blog.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> You write a blog?<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Yeah, I write a blog.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> <i>How many followers</i> do you have?<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> I don’t know … <i>59,538.</i><br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Pete, that's a lot of followers! You can make money writing!<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> Writing is easy. Everyone can write.<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> Not everyone can write well. You can be a writer!<br>
        <b>Pete:</b> I can be a writer. I can be a writer! I can be a writer! Thanks, Anna.<br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Hi, Pete. Hi, Anna.<br>

        <b>Pete:</b> I’m going to <i>be a writer!</i><br>
        <b>Marsha:</b> Good luck, Pete!<br>
        (To Anna) He does know that it’s not easy to be a writer, doesn’t he?<br>
        <b>Anna:</b> There are many <i>different jobs</i> you can have in Washington, D.C. Pete wants to be a writer. <i>I wish him luck.</i> Lots of luck. Until next time!
